After remaining in contact for 15 minutes, it permanently becomes your faithful companion. You establish a telepathic link with it that allows you to command it as long as you are conscious. It gains hit dice until it ties your hit dice, and uses your proficiency modifier instead of its own. It adds your proficiency modifier to the damage it deals with all attacks. In combat, it takes its turn after yours.<br><br>You can't cast this spell again until your companion dies. If your companion is revived, the spell does not persist, although it still retains its memories of you.<br><br>A creature that is only temporarily transformed into a beast is never a valid target for this spell.","empower":""}
