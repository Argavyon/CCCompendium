When a creature moves or makes a weapon attack within 10 feet of the snake, you can activate it as a response for 0 AP to cause it to lunge at the creature. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn.<br><br>The snake vanishes only after the creature fails its saving throw. You can only activate a given snake once between each of your turns.","empower":"Choose one - damage increased to 3d12, or you create two snakes, or poisoned duration becomes 1 minute instead and the creature can repeat the same at the end of each of their turns to end it early."}
