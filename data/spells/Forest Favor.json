Choose one of the following options:<br>* If it is a creature, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. Unwilling creatures can make an Intuition saving throw to avoid this effect. Creatures charmed in this way will attempt to leave the immediate area.<br>* The plant makes a grapple attempt on a creature within 10 feet of itself. It uses your spellcasting stat and proficiency modifier in place of its Strength or Dexterity and proficiency modifier if they would be higher. A creature grappled this way is pulled to the plant.<br>* The plant grows 1d4+2 berries. Each berry heals 3 hit points when eaten. A berry can be eaten for 1 AP once per turn. Berries can be plucked by any creature for 1 AP. Growing berries with this spell again causes all other berries you've created this way to disappear.","empower":"Targets up to three plants."}
