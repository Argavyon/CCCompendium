Creatures in the fog when it is created and who start their turn inside must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they must roll 1d6. They are poisoned and have their speed halved until the start of their next turn on a roll of 1 or 2, are paralyzed until the start of their next turn on a roll of 3 or 4, and are unconscious on a roll of 5 or 6, woken only by taking damage or when the spell ends.<br><br>At the end of each of your turns, the fog expands its area by 5 feet, unless it is in an area of strong wind. It stops expanding once it covers a 60 foot cube.","empower":"Range increased to 300 feet."}
