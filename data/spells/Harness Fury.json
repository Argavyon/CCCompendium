It restores all of its hit points.<br><br>The creature is a berserk husk of its former self. It gains 1 AP, can only take the Attack action, and will always attempt to attack the nearest creature, moving as far as it can to do so. Every time it makes an attack, it takes 1d8 fire damage, ignoring its own resistance and immunity. On a successful hit, it deals the same amount of fire damage it took as bonus damage to its target.<br><br>When the spell ends or the creature reaches 0 hit points, the corpse collapses as the spirit burns out. It can't be targeted by this spell again unless it is brought back to life permanently, then dies again.", "empower": "", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
