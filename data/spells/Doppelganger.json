{"name":"Doppelganger","author":"Levi","tier":4,"tags":["Illusion","Shadow","Concentration","Ritual","Mastery"],"cost":"N/A","range":"120 feet","duration":"1 hour","desc":"As you cast this spell, you must have had sight of the target for at least 1 unbroken minute to record their appearance perfectly within 1 hour before actually activating the spell.<br><br>You craft pure darkness into a copy of the recorded creature, this copy is under your control, and is such an exact copy that it adds +10 to all skill checks and saving throws to falsify its identity pretending to be the actual creature. While the copy is active, you can share its senses, though you lose your own corresponding sense while borrowing the sense of the copy. The copy begins to rapidly dissipate back into shadows if it moves too far away from you. The copy has 10 HP, 0 STR, 0 DEX, 0 CON, and your KNO, INT, and WIL. The copy cannot attack or cast spells, but can otherwise interact with the world as any creature could.<br><br>If at any point the original creature sees the copy it has a instinctive sense of disgust and animosity towards the copy, recognizing it for what it is. For a creature that is aware of both the original creature and the copy at the same time, the copy loses its +10 bonus to skill checks and saving throws.","empower":""}
