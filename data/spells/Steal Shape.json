It becomes bound to you and must obey your commands, although it is not charmed.<br><br>The creature uses the beast's capabilities as its own and completely loses access to all of its prior capabilities, including features, talents, spells, and more. The creature replaces the beast's Knowledge, Intuition, and Willpower with its own stats, however. The transformation fully heals the creature in its new form.<br><br>When you cast this spell, you must set a condition that can be reasonably achieved over the course of the spell. \"Win this battle\" and \"Guard me for 6 months\" are a few examples. You cannot set a condition that would overtly lead to the creature's death, such as \"Until you kill yourself\" or \"When you touch lava\". The spell ends when the condition is achieved, and the spell fails if an invalid condition is given.<br><br>If the creature dies, they transform back to their original form.<br><br>If cast on a willing creature, the AP cost is reduced to 3.","empower":"Add the Ritual tag. The spell now takes 10 minutes to cast regardless of target, and its duration becomes \"Until dispelled\"."}
