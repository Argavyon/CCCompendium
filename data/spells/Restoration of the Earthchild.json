{"name":"Restoration of the Earthchild","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":7,"tags":["Conjuration","Earth","Spirit","Ritual"],"cost":"N/A AP","range":"Self (600 foot radius) ","duration":"Until destroyed","desc":"After 8 hours, the land around you in a 600 foot radius comes to life as it is lifted up on the back of a 100 foot tall tortoise made of solid earth, eyes glowing a bright amber - the Earthchild. Handholds form along its legs, allowing for safe traversal up and down the Earthchild.<br><br>The Earthchild can only move 120 feet at a time. It is incapable of moving in smaller increments of movement. It has a movement speed of 240 feet. It obeys your mental commands as long as you are conscious and on the same plane. If you are unconscious, it follows your last order and then remains still.<br><br>The Earthchild has AC 10, 2500 hit points, and DR 20. It fails all Dexterity saving throws but passes all other saving throws. It moves too predictably to trample mobile creatures. It deals 200 bludgeoning damage to any object or immobile creature it moves through.<br><br>You can't cast this spell again until the Earthchild is destroyed. You can't end this spell early.","empower":""}
