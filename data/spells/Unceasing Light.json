{"name":"Unceasing Light","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":7,"tags":["Evocation","Radiant"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"90 feet","duration":"1 hour","desc":"You fire a small dart of light at a target object or point within range. Upon impact, it embeds itself and then shines brilliant light out to 90 feet, blinding creatures that are within 10 feet of the source. The light prevents Shadow spells from being cast inside, and reveals invisible creatures.<br><br>You can fire another dart for 2 AP during each of your turns as long as the spell continues. A dart that is dislodged has its radius of light halved, and it no longer blinds creatures.<br><br>When the spell ends, all darts lose their light.","empower":"Darts are permanent once embedded, even if the spell ends. Dislodging the darts reduces their range as normal."}
