{"name":"Snapfrost","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Evocation","Cold"],"cost":"1-3 AP","range":"60 feet ","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"For every AP spent on this spell, a 10 foot radius sphere centered on a point within range suddenly and abruptly freezes. Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 6d4 cold damage and have their movement speed reduced by half on their next turn. A successful saving throw deals half damage and does not reduce movement speed. A creature can only take damage once from this spell, no matter how many spheres they are within.<br><br>The freeze also freezes all water in the area. Creatures standing in water in the area are restrained. They can spend 1 AP to make a Strength saving throw to break free if only their feet are caught, or 2 AP if they are frozen over more of their body. On a success, they break free.","empower":"Choose one - create two more spheres, or damage increased to 10d4, or movement speed reduced to 5 feet on a failed saving throw."}
