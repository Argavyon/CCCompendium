All creatures that can hear it must succeed on an Intuition saving throw or be caught up in the choir, doing nothing except singing for the duration of the spell. A creature that succeeds is immune to the spell until they finish a rest.<br><br>The choir protects those who sing with them. Any creature that attacks a singing creature is struck for 10d10 radiant damage, regardless if the attack hit or missed. Singing creatures are immune to all conditions and automatically succeed on all saving throws, taking no damage from spells. They do not need to eat, drink, or sleep while they sing.<br><br>When the spell ends, singing creatures are left with a sense of hope and wonder.", "empower": "", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
