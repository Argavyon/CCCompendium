An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to avoid the effect.<br><br>While poisoned in this way, the creature falls unconscious and has a vision of standing before the gods, as their spirit temporarily connects to the gods. The creature can ask the gods anything. The gods can respond however they please.<br><br>The spell ends early if the target is damaged, but ending the spell early invites the wrath of the gods on whichever creature caused the spell to end, dealing 300 radiant damage that cannot be reduced or negated. A successful Willpower saving throw halves the damage taken.<br><br>A creature can only visit the gods once per week. Successive uses only knock the creature unconscious for 1 minute instead.","empower":""}
