They have 1 hit point, AC 12, and 50 feet movement speed. They take their turn after you. They cannot be commanded - they will always move towards the nearest hostile creature and make one attack using your proficiency modifier and spellcasting stat to determine attack and damage bonuses, dealing 1d8 unholy damage on a hit. A creature hit by any skeleton is automatically hit by all other skeletons that attack it this turn.<br><br>If a skeleton is killed, it immediately revives in the nearest empty space to you. All skeletons die when the spell ends.<br><br>Casting this spell again destroys the skeletons from the first cast.","empower":"Summon up to thirty-six skeletons from an equal amount of skulls instead."}
