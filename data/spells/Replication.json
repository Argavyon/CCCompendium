{"name":"Replication","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Divination","Shadow","Space","Ritual"],"cost":"N/A","range":"300 feet","duration":"1 year","desc":"You take 10 minutes to sift through a 40 foot cube within range with shadows, recording everything within the area down to the nearest detail. Once complete, an exact copy of the area manifests as an indestructible 6 inch cube in your hand. You can use the cube for 2 AP to convert a 40 foot cube area centered on you into a replica of the area, recreated with shadows. This completely covers the area you are in - creatures within the area are pulled in to your replica. Any walls and objects that did not exist in your replica that are inside the area are harmlessly phased out of existence while the replica is active.<br><br>The shadows that comprise everything will disintegrate if they leave the area. Magical objects do not have their properties retained - a copy of a magic scroll would have its writing preserved, but would be unusable for its spell, for instance. In all other regards, they are perfectly real, and may even cause harm.<br><br>When you leave the area, any creation disappears and returns to a cube in your hand. You can create up to three such cubes - creating a fourth cube destroys the oldest cube. Leaving an area will un-phase any phased walls and objects, harmlessly shunting creatures that would be inside a wall or object to the nearest empty space.","empower":""}
