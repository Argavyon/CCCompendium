Every creature you choose in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing and 2d4 poison damage. On a successful saving throw, creatures only take the piercing damage. Small creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw, and tiny creatures automatically fail. <br><br>A creature that takes poison damage contracts the Ratbite disease. It takes an additional 1 poison damage each time it would normally take poison damage, or when it would receive healing. When it uses a hit die to recover hit points, it only restores hit points equal to its Constitution. It can make a Constitution saving throw after using a hit die during a break to attempt to recover from the disease.","empower": "Choose one: radius increased by 10 feet, poison damage increased by 3d4, or piercing damage increased by 2d4.","author": "CrusaderDroid"}
