Every creature you choose in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing and 1d4 poison damage.<br><br>A creature that takes poison damage contracts the Ratbite disease. It takes an additional 1 poison damage each time it would normally take poison damage, or when it would receive healing. When it uses a hit die to recover hit points, it only restores hit points equal to its Constitution. It can make a Constitution saving throw after using a hit die during a break to attempt to recover from the disease.", "empower": "Poison damage increased to 2d4.
