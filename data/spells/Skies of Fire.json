{"name":"Skies of Fire","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":9,"tags":["Evocation","Fire","Concentration","Ritual"],"cost":"N/A","range":"10 miles","duration":"1 minute","desc":"Immediately upon beginning to cast this spell, a thin pillar of fire rises from you and into the atmosphere, revealing your location until the spell ends. After 15 minutes of casting, you can select four 1 mile radius targets and four half-mile radius targets anywhere within range. The skies turn a terrifyingly beautiful orange-red as fire descends in manifold waves upon the targeted areas. Creatures with 10 or fewer hit dice are utterly incinerated if they start their turn in range, while all other creatures that start their turn in range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 100 fire damage, halved on a success. Objects with a size lower than Huge are incinerated, while Huge and larger objects take 100 fire damage at the start of each of your turns.<br><br>You can't move or take any other action while casting or concentrating on this spell.","empower":""}
