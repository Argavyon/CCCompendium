{"name":"Emerald Knives","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Evocation","Poison"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self (60 foot cone)","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You hurl a fan of knives crafted from poison magic in a 60 foot cone. Every creature you choose within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the knife harmlessly passes through them and flips around, aimed at their back. On a success, the knife misses completely and vanishes.<br><br>When a creature with a knife at their back attempts to make a weapon attack, you can spend 1 AP as a reaction to cause the knife behind them to stab them, dealing 5d6 poison damage and causing them to be poisoned until the end of your next turn. The creature must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they lose the attack and all AP spent on it. The knife then vanishes.","empower":"Choose one - damage increased to 8d6, or damage reduced to 3d6 and response cost reduced to 0 AP, or range increased to Self (60 foot radius)."}
