Unwilling creatures can make an Intuition saving throw to prevent the effect.<br><br>While the copy is embedded, you always know where the target is, and can communicate with them.

A creature that is targeted with Break Curse can choose to make an Intuition saving throw to remove the copy.<br><br>If you die, the copy remains in the target's mind until dispelled.
