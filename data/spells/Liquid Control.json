You can't target a creature or area twice with the same effect, but you can still choose the same effect twice otherwise.<br>* You condense water vapor into a container no bigger than 2 gallons. This water is not potable.<br>* You neutralize a poison. No effect on a creature already poisoned.<br>* You manipulate about one gallon of water freely for 1 minute. You can't do damage with this water, and it can't move more than 30 feet from you before you lose control of it.<br>* You increase the potency of a poison, adding +1 to its DC. This can only be used once per poison. You can also increase the strength of alcohol this way, causing creatures to become drunk more easily.<br>* You drench the ground in a 5 foot square. Solid surfaces become slippery tripping hazards, while dirt surfaces become muddy. Creatures that move more than 5 feet past a slippery surface must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, while muddy terrain is treated as difficult terrain.","empower":""}
