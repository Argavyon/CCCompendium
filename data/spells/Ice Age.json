The hailstones occupy a 10 foot radius and displace creatures into the nearest adjacent empty space, and creatures within 20 feet of each hailstone on arrival must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 cold and 4d6 bludgeoning damage, halved on a success.<br><br>When you finish casting this spell, for each turn it took to cast this spell, you summon two more hailstones. Hailstones then remain for 1 minute, with AC 10 and 200 hit points. Hailstones are immune to damage before you finish casting the spell, and disappear if your spell is interrupted before you finish casting or you drop a hailstone on top of another hailstone.<br><br>Creatures can only take damage from one hailstone on each of your turns.","empower":""}
