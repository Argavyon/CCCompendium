The area in the portal becomes water, extending down infinitely, and is threatened by an abyssal denizen. Any creature that ends their turn in the water must make a Dexterity saving throw or be grabbed by the denizen's tentacles and pulled underwater 20 feet, taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Creatures without a swim speed have disadvantage on the saving throw.<br><br>At the start of each of an affected creature's turns while grabbed, it must repeat the saving throw. On a success, it breaks free and can swim back up and no longer needs to roll saving throws against this spell. On a failure, it is dragged down 20 more feet in addition to taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage.<br><br>If the spell ends, water first gushes out at high speed, enough to eject every creature in the water into the air. They are launched a number of feet into the air equal to the number of feet they were underwater.","empower":""}
