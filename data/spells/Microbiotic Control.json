You can't target a creature or area twice with the same effect, but you can still choose the same effect twice otherwise.<br>* Target creature heals 1 hit point as microbes accelerate the natural healing process. After 1 minute, the target heals an additional 1d4 hit points.<br>* Target creature takes 1 damage as microbes work to attack it from the inside. This damage can't be prevented, reduced, or increased.<br>* You cause a 10 foot area of earth to become either more or less fertile. Fertile earth is sure to grow any plants placed in the area. Unfertile earth will never yield plants, and any non-magical plants in the area wither and die over 1 minute.<br>* You inflict or remove a simple sickness on a target creature, such as the common cold. This sickness imposes a -2 penalty on ability checks, and remains for 24 hours. Creatures can make a Constitution saving throw to prevent the effect.<br>* You contaminate or decontaminate up to five pieces of food. Contaminated food grants no benefit when eaten, and forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 8 hours. The victim can repeat the saving throw once every 15 minutes to overcome the effect early.","empower":""}
