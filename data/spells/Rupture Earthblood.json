At the start of your next turn, it explodes into a shower of magma that rains down onto a 40 foot radius centered on the original area. Creatures in the central 20 foot area take 6d6 fire damage and are flung 20 feet into the air, while creatures on the outer 20 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 fire damage. The 40 foot radius then becomes filled with lava, which acts as per the Lava Flow spell, save that it does not move at the start of your turns. The lava disappears when the spell ends.","empower":"Also flings three 10 foot radius globs of lava to any three points you choose when the magma bursts."}
