For the duration, creatures that die within 60 feet of you restore one hit die to you, and can be optionally sent to the afterlife, destroying their body. Reanimated and undead creatures must succeed on a Willpower saving throw when targeting you with an attack or spell, losing their turn on a failure. Your body turns partly ethereal, causing attacking creatures to roll 1d20 when attacking you with a weapon. On a roll of 10 or lower, the weapon harmlessly phases through you.","empower":""}
