{"name":"Lupusam's Biologia","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":8,"tags":["Necromancy","Eldritch","Water"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Touch","duration":"1 hour","desc":"You freely modify the stats, movement speed, resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities of any biological creature you touch. You can set any stat up to double its current value, or down to its negative value. You can set movement speed from 0 to twice as much. A creature can have up to two immunities, and can have an additional immunity for every vulnerability it has.<br><br>An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to resist the effect. At the end of each of its turns while affected, it rolls 1d20, adding 1 for each time it makes this roll. On a roll of 16 or better, the spell ends. <br><br>The process is biologically taxing on the creature. If it is used on the same creature within 7 days of the last successful spell, the body violently rejects the changes, and the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 30d10 poison damage, halved on a success.","empower":""}
