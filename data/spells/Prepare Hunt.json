Each mount can take any shape you choose. They have a movement speed of 90 feet and are immune to all effects and damage. They and their rider are immune to damage from falling.<br><br>Any creature that's mounted gains awareness of all other creatures within 1 mile, and can choose to focus on a wounded creature of whom they are aware for 1 AP. Once focused, a mounted creature can move 30 feet closer every turn for free, and that creature is always visible to them even when hidden or invisible.<br><br>A creature can't be forcibly dismounted. They are immune to being knocked prone, and any effect that would normally dismount them instead causes the mount to reappear and catch them at their new location. A mount only fades if their rider willingly dismisses it or is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.","empower":"Duration becomes 7 days."}
