{"name":"Black Bile","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Necromancy","Disease","Water"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"30 feet","duration":"Until cured","desc":"You invisibly contaminate a body of liquid within range. Any creature that drinks this liquid becomes afflicted by Black Bile, a withering disease causing the creature to cough out horrid globs of black bile upon drinking any liquid. The creature is poisoned for the duration, and always rolls the minimum value on all hit dice used for recovery. Each time the creature would drink something, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it coughs out the liquid with horrid black bile mixed in, and takes 1d6 poison damage. Damage taken this way reduces the creature's maximum hit points by the same amount.<br><br>A creature that succeeds in three Constitution saving throws within 24 hours without any failures is on the path to recovery and has advantage on all future saving throws against this spell. A creature that achieves this again is cured on the next day.","empower":""}
