All creatures inside the realm are contained within the entrance on the outside. The realm on the inside looks exactly like the plane outside, save that it ends in solid force at the border of the spell. Creatures that were taken inside maintain their relative position.<br><br>When the spell ends, all creatures return to their relative position outside of the realm.
