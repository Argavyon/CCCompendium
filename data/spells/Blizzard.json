{"name":"Blizzard","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Conjuration","Cold","Delayed"],"cost":"6 AP","range":"120 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"For each turn you spend at least 1 AP towards casting this spell, you create a 30 foot radius, 100 foot tall cylinder of falling snow at a target location within range that you can see. When you complete this spell, all snowing areas intensify into chilling blizzards. Creatures in any area take 6d6 cold damage, and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 6d6 additional cold damage, halved on a success. The blizzards remain until the start of your next turn, obscuring all vision in and out of the area and acting as difficult terrain.","empower":"Immediately creates two areas when you begin to cast this spell."}
