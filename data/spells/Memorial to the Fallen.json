{"name":"Memorial to the Fallen","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":1,"tags":["Conjuration","Forbidden (Worldshaping)","Ritual"],"cost":"N/A","range":"30 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You construct a reverent monument over 10 minutes in memory of a creature you knew who has died. The monument can take any shape within a 10 foot cube, centered on a point within range.<br><br>As long as the monument exists, the creature's soul can always choose to rest in the monument, ignoring all other spell and creature effects. While inhabited, creatures within 10 feet can make a DC 15 Intuition check to listen to the soul inside the monument. Even on a success, most of the message tends to be garbled, with only a few words being intelligible. Whether the creature succeeds or not, it can't attempt this again until it completes a rest.<br><br>Casting this spell again on an inhabited monument creates an ethereal body for 24 hours for the inhabitant. It can't move more than 10 feet from the monument. It can speak and be heard while in this body, and it can choose to vanish while in the body and not speak.","empower":"Empower this spell as if it was a tier 9 spell. Casting an empowered version on an inhabited monument creates a replica of the physical body of the creature, allowing for the creature to be revived within the duration."}
