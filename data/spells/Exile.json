If they are a native, they are set in a harmless demiplane and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to return to their prior location.<br><br>If the creature is not from this plane, they are instead locked in a battle of wills with you. They are partially phased out of the plane and can't be targeted by anything. At the start of each of its turns, it makes a competing Willpower roll against your spellcasting stat. If it gets two consecutive successes or your concentration is broken, it ends the spell early and deals 4d12 psychic damage to you and stuns you until the end of your next turn from the backlash of the spell. If it gets two consecutive failures, it is banished from the plane for a year and a day, sent back to its native plane, and the spell ends.","empower":"An extraplanar creature is banished if it fails twice, even if it succeeds once after failing."}
