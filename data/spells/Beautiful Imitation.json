If it is reduced to 0 hit points before you finish the spell, the spell is interrupted and you lose all MP spent.<br><br>When you first begin casting this spell, choose a creature you can see. When you finish, the flower blooms and unveils a copy of that creature, made of plant fiber. It is an exact copy of that creature in its current condition, save that its creature type is plant. It takes its turn after yours and unerringly follows your mental commands.","empower":"Duration increased to 15 minutes."}
