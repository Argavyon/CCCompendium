They shed dim light out to 5 feet. Each time the creature takes damage, they shed bright light out to 5 feet and dim light out another 5 feet, with both increasing by 5 feet each time they take damage.<br><br>If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, the light within explodes outwards, striking all creatures within the bright light that the target chooses.
