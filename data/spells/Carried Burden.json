Every chosen creature other than yourself is healed for 1d6 hit points, plus additional healing equal to your spellcasting stat times the number of AP spent to cast this spell.<br><br>At the start of your next turn, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to half the damage healed, to a maximum of 25. On a failure, you lose AP equal to the spell's AP cost as the burden proves too heavy for you. You repeat this saving throw at the start of each of your turns until you succeed, with the DC dropping by 5 on each failure.", "empower": "Healing increased to 2d6.", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
