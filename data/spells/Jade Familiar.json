{"name":"Jade Familiar","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Conjuration","Poison"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Self","duration":"Until dispelled","desc":"You create a noxious being of poison magic which takes the form of a cobra made of solid jade. It accompanies you by hanging on your person.<br><br>While your familiar remains, it is fiercely protective of you. When a creature attacks you within 60 feet for the first time during its turn, your familiar lashes out, making a magic weapon attack using your stats. On a hit, the target takes 3d12 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of their turn. When a creature targets you with a spell that deals damage, the familiar leaps forward and follows the magic back to the caster, strangling and biting at them. The caster loses 1 AP and takes 1d12 poison damage at the start of each of its turns until it uses 2 AP to make a Strength saving throw to throw the familiar off on a success, whereupon it returns to you.<br><br>The familiar has AC 15 and 30 hit points, and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points. It uses your spellcasting stat for all saving throws.","empower":""}
