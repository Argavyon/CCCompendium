{"name":"Crushing Awe","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Enchantment","Fey"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self (30 foot radius)","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You emanate an unnatural aura of awe out to a 30 foot radius. Each creature within must make an Intuition saving throw or take 3d6 psychic damage, lose 1 AP on their next turn, and repeat the saving throw until they succeed once or fail three times. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is left in a delirious stupor for 1 minute and can't act unless they are damaged or an adjacent creature spends 2 AP to shake them free, whereupon they fall unconscious if they are still at 0 hit points.","empower":"Any number of creatures you choose are unaffected. A successful saving throw deals half damage."}
