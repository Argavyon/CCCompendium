A creature can only benefit from one tree per turn.<br><br>The tree has AC 12, 20 hit points, and vulnerability to slashing and fire damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, it falls in a 10 foot long, 10 foot wide line away from its attacker. Creatures in range must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage. The tree then disappears.<br><br>If the tree cannot grow to its full height, it first deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage to any object impeding its way, continuing to grow if this damage would destroy the object. If it does not destroy the object, the tree violently splinters and destroys itself.", "empower": "", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
