{"name":"Boreal Grasp","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":6,"tags":["Conjuration","Cold","Concentration"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"120 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"A pale hand travels from you up to 30 feet towards target creature or object within range you can see. At the start of each of your turns, the hand moves 30 feet closer, even if you can't see the target any more, and even if it is out of range.<br><br>Upon contact with the hand, it freezes the target and everything within a 10 foot radius that is touching the target. Objects frozen this way are petrified and invulnerable. Creatures must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are petrified and invulnerable. On a success, they instead lose 2 AP and have their movement speed reduced to 5 feet so long as they are in contact with the hand or anything affected by the hand.<br><br>When the spell ends, or when an affected creature is moved away from the hand, any petrified creature or object returns to normal and is no longer invulnerable.","empower":""}
