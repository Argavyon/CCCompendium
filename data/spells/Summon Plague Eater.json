{"name":"Summon Plague Eater","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Conjuration","Disease","Summoning","Concentration"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You call forth an ethereal plague eater - a vaguely animalistic being that devours sickness. It marks out a 60 foot radius around itself. If a creature in this area would take poison damage, the plague eater instead devours the poison damage, negating it entirely. If any other creature attempts to cast a Disease or Poison spell within range, the plague eater devours the spell, causing MP to be spent but preventing all other effects. If a creature would be poisoned, the plague eater devours the poison and prevents the condition from being applied.<br><br>At the end of each of your turns, the plague eater attacks one creature you choose within range. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 poison damage, increased by 2d6 damage each time it had eaten damage, poison, or a spell between your last turn and this turn, and become poisoned until the end of your next turn. A successful saving throw halves the damage and prevents being poisoned. Poisoned creatures are vulnerable to the damage from this spell.<br><br>If the plague eater devours three or more effects in one turn, it becomes berserk for the duration. A berserk plague eater must attack three targets within range each turn. You can choose which targets, but you must choose three targets when possible.","empower":""}
