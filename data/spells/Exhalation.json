All creatures within the area of effect must succeed on either a Dexterity, Constitution, or Intuition saving throw, chosen by the creature, or take 10d10 arcane damage, halved on a success. A creature loses all of their movement speed if they failed a Dexterity saving throw, loses all damage immunities if they failed a Constitution saving throw, and is frightened if they failed an Intuition saving throw. All effects last until the end of your next turn.","empower":""}
