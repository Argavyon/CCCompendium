When any other creature makes contact with the powder, it soaks through the sink and is absorbed into the bloodstream. The creature must then make a Constitution saving throw - on a failure, the powder takes hold and causes the creature to view whichever object was covered in powder with extreme feelings of dread. Each time they see the object, they must make an Intuition saving throw or be frightened of it for 1 hour, or until 1 minute passes while it is out of sight.","empower":""}
