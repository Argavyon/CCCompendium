{"name":"Eraser","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Evocation","Space"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"30 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"A 15 foot long, 5 foot wide, 5 foot tall line that starts and ends anywhere within range is torn off from reality. All creatures in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 8d6 damage, halved on a success, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Creatures must then move out of the area into the nearest adjacent empty space if possible - you decide where they move if they failed the saving throw, and they decide where to move if they succeeded instead.<br><br>The affected area is temporarily gone from reality. Anything in the area when it disappeared is unaffected until it returns, and any creatures there can't take any action. What remains in its former location is a blank hole in reality that cannot be navigated through by any means. Attacks and spells that would travel through the hole end at the hole.<br><br>When the spell ends, the removed area returns to its location.","empower":"Range increased to 60 feet. Line length increased to 20 feet."}
