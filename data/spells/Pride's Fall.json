{"name":"Pride's Fall","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":2,"tags":["Conjuration","Poison","Silent","Still"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"8 hours","desc":"You conjure and fling a transparent, barely-visible dart of poison at the target creature. It must make a Dexterity saving throw or be struck by the dart. A creature that can't see you or the dart automatically fails the saving throw.<br><br>Once it hits the creature, the dart's poison subtly leaks through. At any time as a response to the creature taking any action, you can spend 1 AP to trigger the poison. The creature takes 2d10 poison damage per AP spent on the triggering action and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn and has its action canceled.","empower":"Reduces the AP cost by 1."}
