You can mentally command these objects.<br><br>The objects have a rudimentary intelligence. They can obey your orders and carry out complex commands and communicate with you through elaborate pantomime that is unintelligible to other creatures. They can observe a small area around them and can understand any languages you can speak. When observed, unless you explicitly command otherwise, they remain still and are indistinguishable from normal objects.<br><br>If an animated object is destroyed, the spell ends for that object.","empower":""}
