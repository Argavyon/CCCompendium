{"name":"Universal Communion","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Enchantment","Spirit","Ritual"],"cost":"N/A AP","range":"Self (300 foot radius) ","duration":"24 hours","desc":"You spend 15 minutes preparing the space around you. At the completion, you become seated as everything in the area within range of the spell becomes connected on an existential level to everything else within the area. Everything can communicate with everything else, regardless of shared language or even ability to communicate.<br><br>Most things are unremarkable. The average stone and plant has nothing to say and can only communicate in images if it did. Stones meant as a memorial may tell the history behind them, while plants that have witnessed creatures recently may do the same. Deceased creatures may vary in their willingness and capability to speak - most will not communicate with their killers, while some may have been driven to madness by their death. The spell does not compel anything to speak, only grant it the opportunity to speak.<br><br>A creature that physically harms another creature within the area of the spell is excluded from the spell's effect for the duration. This has no effect on creatures that can cause damage through speaking or merely existing.","empower":"The spell is instead cast in 15 seconds."}
