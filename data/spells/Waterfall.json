{"name":"Waterfall","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Conjuration","Water"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"90 feet","duration":"1 hour","desc":"100 feet above a target point within range that you can see, vast amounts of water begin to pour down, covering a line up to 30 feet wide centered on that point. The water douses flames and Fire spells that make contact with it, and heavily obscures creatures on the other side. Creatures that enter the water during their movement have their movement set to 0 for the rest of the turn and must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Creatures forcibly moved into the water are knocked prone.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, you can move the waterfall up to 10 feet in any horizontal direction. It can't change its orientation.<br><br>The water vanishes one second upon hitting the ground, instead recycling itself to reappear at the top again. Pollutants and other objects swept up in the water will continue to be a part of the waterfall until the spell ends.","empower":"Increases the force of the water to inflict 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, and half of that on a success."}
