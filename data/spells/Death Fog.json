{"name":"Death Fog","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Conjuration","Poison"],"cost":"1 to 3 AP","range":"90 feet","duration":"1 minute ","desc":"You create a sphere of dark purple fog with a radius of 10 feet, plus 5 feet per AP spent past the first, at target point within range that you can see. The fog heavily obscures all vision into and out of it, and creatures inside when it is created and when they end their turns inside must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 6d4 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds takes half damage and is not poisoned. <br><br>Damage from this spell is treated as if it had the lethal property. Creatures that are not within the fog but were poisoned by it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, removing it on a success.","empower":"Radius increased to 20 feet, plus 10 feet per AP spent."}
