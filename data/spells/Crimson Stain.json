{"name":"Crimson Stain","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Necromancy","Disease","Forbidden (Blood)"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Self (30 foot radius)","duration":"8 hours","desc":"Black blood bursts from your heart, skewering you and attempting to skewer every creature within 30 feet. You take anywhere between 10 to 30 piercing damage as you choose and infect yourself with the Crimson Stain disease, while creatures in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and also be infected. A successful saving throw deals half damage and avoids infection.<br><br>Creatures with the Crimson Stain visibly have blood seeping through the skin covering the heart. If they spend more than 2 AP during a turn, blood pushes through, forcing the creature to roll one of its remaining hit die, take damage equal to the result, and lose the hit die. A creature without hit dice remaining takes damage equal to half the difference between their maximum hit points and their current hit points.","empower":"You are immune to the Crimson Stain, but are still a carrier of the disease. Damage maximum increased to 45."}
