Creatures within 120 feet you choose that can hear you speak must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be deafened to everything except your words. Creatures with fewer hit dice than your character level that can hear you must succeed on an Intuition saving throw or be charmed or frightened by you when you speak, and remain this way until they take damage or the spell ends.","empower":""}
