Four seconds later, a 5 foot wide, 300 foot tall line extending from you out to one mile splits open in a flash of lightning, then splits apart as it is banished. Everything within 25 feet of the line other than you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 8d8 slashing damage and 8d8 lightning damage, halved on a success. Everything in the line takes an additional 50 damage which cannot be reduced or prevented in any way, and is banished to a demiplane where they cannot take action or be harmed for the duration.<br><br>For the duration of the spell, the split remains. It is totally impossible to cross the split or attack or affect any creature on the opposite side through any means.<br><br>You can't end this spell early through any circumstances. When the spell ends, anything that survived the damage returns from the demiplane.","empower":""}
