On a failure, you subtly twist their mind and implant an aversion to all creatures other than you. They are considered an unwilling target for all effects and can't be targeted or affected by effects from other creatures that would grant a benefit to them. When another creature that isn't hostile to them ends their turn within 5 feet of the target, the target immediately moves 5 feet away from that creature if possible.<br><br>If the target creature sees you, it is charmed by you for the duration. It is not charmed if it can see you cast the spell.<br><br>The spell ends early if you damage the creature.","empower":""}
