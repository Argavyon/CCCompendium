Objects currently held by a creature will also drag the creature along if they fail a Strength saving throw.<br><br>If an object would be moved into a creature's space, the creature must make their choice of a Strength or Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked away 5 feet and fall prone.
