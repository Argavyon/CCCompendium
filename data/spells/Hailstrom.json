All creatures inside when this occurs must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a success.<br><br>A cloud of super conductive frozen gases lingers in the area until the start of your next turn, acting as difficult terrain for creatures that aren't immune or resistant to cold damage. At the start of your next turn, the gasses collapse back into another vortex and repeat this spell's damage to all creatures inside, then dissipate. <br><br>When at least one creature in the cloud takes lightning damage from an attack or effect while this cloud remains, the cloud immediately repeats this spell's damage to all other creatures in the cloud, and all creatures that did not take lightning damage from the triggering attack or effect also receive half as much lightning damage.","empower":"Remove the AP cost of this spell."}
