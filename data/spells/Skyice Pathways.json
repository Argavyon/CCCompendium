Each pathway is a 5 foot wide, 30 foot long line that starts and ends at a target point within range. The pathways remain until the spell ends.<br><br>Creatures caught in the way of each pathway must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d8 cold damage and are restrained inside the pathway. They can spend 2 AP during their turn to make a Strength saving throw to break free of the pathway, destroying the segment they occupy. A creature can only be affected by one pathway.","empower":"Duration increases to 8 hours. Restrained creatures must use 3 AP to make a saving throw."}
