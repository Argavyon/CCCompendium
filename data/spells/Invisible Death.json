Any creature that is in the area when it is created must make a Dexterity saving throw or be ensnared in the spell.<br><br>The acid is invisible once created, unless darkened by magic. Any creature that moves into the acid is ensnared and stops moving immediately. Ensnared creatures can't move or take action unless an adjacent creature spends 2 AP to pull them free. Every minute, an ensnared creature takes 2d6 acid damage, then can make a Strength saving throw to free itself.","empower":""}
