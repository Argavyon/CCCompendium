At the start of your next turn, they arm themselves. The next time a creature moves within 5 feet of the sphere, it explodes, illuminating a 20 foot radius for 1 minute. All creatures in that range are covered in the light and glow, emitting dim light out to 20 feet and becoming unable to hide or conceal their presence for the duration.<br><br>When you cast this spell, you can indicate which creatures do not set off spheres when they approach. You do not need to see any creatures or creature types you wish to exclude.
