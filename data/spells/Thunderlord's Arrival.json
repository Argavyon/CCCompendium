During this time you gain a birds eye view of the area around you and must select a point open to the sky. This point crackles with static electricity that nearby creatures can intuitively sense danger from.<br><br>At the start of your next turn, you crash down with a lightning bolt at the target point, dealing 4d6 lightning damage to creatures within 5 feet, and emitting a shockwave for 30 feet. Creatures hit by the shockwave are pushed back 5 feet if possible and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail the save are knocked prone.<br><br>If cast at a higher tier you may bring 1 other creature with you for each tier past 4. These creatures must be touching you when this spell is cast, and will arrive at the target location harmlessly in the same relative position.","empower":""}
