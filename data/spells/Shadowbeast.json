{"name":"Shadowbeast","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":6,"tags":["Illusion","Shadow","Concentration","Mastery"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self ","duration":"1 minute","desc":"Your shadow transforms into one that matches a hideous quadrupedal beast. At the start of each of your turns, it tries to attack one creature within 30 feet you choose. They must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 piercing damage, halved on a success. At the end of each of your turns, it lies in wait and attacks the first creature to attack you within its range before the start of your next turn.<br><br>Your shadow is more malleable in this form. You can use it to manipulate objects from up to 30 feet away, and you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. You can take the Hide action for 1 AP as your shadow quickly obscures you. If you would be reduced to 0 hit points, your shadow intercepts the attack or spell, ending the spell immediately and preventing all effects that would have affected you.","empower":""}
