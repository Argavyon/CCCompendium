{"name":"Uri's Terraform","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":8,"tags":["Transmutation","Beast","Earth","Plant","Water","Ritual"],"cost":"N/A","range":"Self (10 mile radius)","duration":"Permanent","desc":"Over the course of 8 hours, you begin to shape the surrounding land into a lush paradise capable of untold biological diversity. It starts with a roughly 10 foot radius around you, then expands by another roughly 10 feet at the end of each of your turns. You determine the exact shape of the land, including the creation or destruction of mountains, caves, valleys, rivers, lakes, and other geological features. As long as you are still casting this spell, you can make changes to anything at any point in time.<br><br>The land is impossibly good for all living creatures. Food and water are always pure and can never be contaminated or poisoned by any means. Creatures that take a break within the area automatically heal for a number of hit points equal to their total hit dice. Food is particularly nutritious - a creature that eats anything from this area is satisfied for 24 hours.<br><br>The spell is an exhausting process. You can't cast this spell as part of a rest. If the spell is interrupted, the area ceases expanding.","empower":""}
