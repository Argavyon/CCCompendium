On a success, they are displaced into an adjacent empty space not occupied by a line and must make a Constitution saving throw or take 14d6 arcane damage, halved on a success. The lines remain for the duration.<br><br>Attacks and spells that pass through the lines are harmlessly shunted into an alternate plane. Creatures that are pushed into a line, or were thrown through the rift, are removed from the plane and can't take action until the end of the duration. <br><br>When the spell ends, all creatures within are thrown back through to their original locations, taking 20d6 arcane damage.","empower":""}
