{"name":"Titan Vine","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Conjuration","Plant"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self (60 foot line)","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"A massive vine, 15 feet wide, bursts from your palms and zigzags through the ground in front of you into a 60 foot long line. Any creature in the way must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, they move out of the way into the nearest empty space. On a failure, they take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and are restrained until the start of your next turn. Your turn then ends.<br><br>At the start of your next turn, you rip the vine out of the ground, flinging every restrained creature 30 feet into the air and landing behind you. Their relative position to you is preserved - a creature 30 feet away will land 30 feet away from you. If a creature is moved into a space it cannot occupy, it stops its movement in the closest possible space immediately, takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, and must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn.","empower":"Adds 2d6 piercing damage from thorns. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw still take this damage."}
