{"name":"Reinkarnation","author":"Levi","tier":5,"tags":["Necromancy","Fey"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Touch","duration":"1 minute / Varies","desc":"You call upon the spirit of a deceased creature using an image of its likeness in life. This spell fails if the intended spirit does not recognize the image as a depiction of itself, or rejects the invitation.<br><br>If successful, the spirit appears as an ethereal reconstruction of its appearance in life anchored to the image, and is maintained this way for up to 1 minute. The spirit can be spoken to and respond, and has all of its memories and personality in life, but it cannot interact with the material plane or move more than 5ft away from the image. The spirit is not under the caster's control, and may end the spell at any time by choosing to depart.<br><br>While a spirit is successfully anchored to its image, and the image is placed (or directly drawn) on an intact corpse of the same species as the spirit was in life which has been dead for less than 1 hour, if the spirit is willing, it may possess the corpse and revive in that body. When this occurs, the resultant revived creature's features morph to some degree to resemble the spirit's original appearance over the next 24 hours, and during this time this spell can be dispelled targeting the revived creature. After this period passes, the spell becomes permanent and can no longer be dispelled. The spell instead becomes permanent immediately if the intact corpse originally belonged to the spirit in the first place.","empower":""}
