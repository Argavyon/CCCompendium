On a failure, choose a stat. That creature treats that stat as if it was 4 points lower for the duration. This can cause the creature's maximum hit points or AC to change, but can't deal damage by itself - hit points over the maximum are treated as temporary hit points.<br><br>The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ignoring the spell for the purposes of this saving throw only. On a success, the spell ends.","empower":"Choose one - choose a second stat, which is treated as if it was 2 points lower, or range increased to 60 feet."}
