{"name":"Hunter","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Divination","Psychic","Delayed"],"cost":"9 AP","range":"600 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"Upon casting this spell, your mind searches for a creature you are familiar with within range that has its own mind. If no such creature is in range, so long as you continue casting the spell, the range increases by 600 feet. A creature is familiar to you if you have damaged it before, it has damaged you, or you've seen it for 1 minute within the past 24 hours, or you've had a conversation with it for 1 minute within the past month.<br><br>Upon finding a creature, you begin to bombard it with constant mental attacks. The target creature must succeed on an Intuition saving throw or take 3d6 psychic damage per AP spent this turn casting this spell. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage. Record the result of each saving throw made against this spell.<br><br>Upon completing the spell, check the number of failed saves to the number of succeeded saves. If the successes are greater than the failures, you take 2d6 psychic damage per success. If the failures are equal to or greater than the successes, the target takes 2d6 psychic damage per failure and is stunned until the start of your next turn.","empower":""}
