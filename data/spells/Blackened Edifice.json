The spell fails if there is insufficient room for this construction.<br><br>The tower emanates unholy energy. Undead and reanimated creatures that start their turn within 60 feet gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting stat at the start of each of their turns.<br><br>You can spend 1 AP once per turn to have the obelisk blast a target creature within 120 feet with a ray of unholy magic. It must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 unholy damage. Undead and reanimated creatures are healed for the same amount instead, even if they don't normally absorb unholy damage.<br><br>The tower has AC 14 and 120 hit points. Casting this spell again while a tower already exists destroys the first tower.","empower":"The obelisk can target a second creature, but it must be Undead or reanimated."}
