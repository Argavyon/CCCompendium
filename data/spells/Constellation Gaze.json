You are blinded while the spell remains active, but you can precisely sense the presence of creatures within 60 feet. Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 AP to fix your gaze upon a creature, who must succeed on an Intuition saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage and be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.", "empower": "Creatures remain frightened as long as they can see you. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect early. A creature that is frightened and targeted again takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage.", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
