{"name":"Summon Harphest","tier":3,"tags":["Enchantment","Eldritch","Summoning"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self (120 foot radius) ","duration":"10 minutes","desc":"You summon a Harphest - an intangible yet physical voice from the Sea of Possibility. It speaks honeyed madness into the ears of creatures within range. Now and at the start of each of your turns, up to six random creatures within range must make an Intuition saving throw. On a failure, on their next turn, they roll 1d20 to determine their action:<br>- On a roll of 1 to 5, the creature falls prone, screaming. Their turn ends.<br>- On a roll of 6 to 15, overlaying voices and visions distract the creature. They flail about, making one weapon attack on a random adjacent creature if possible. Their turn ends.<br>- On a roll of 16 to 20, the creature becomes frightened and loses 1 AP, but can act normally.<br><br>You cannot end this spell normally. You must make a DC 15 check with your spellcasting stat during your turn to end the spell. You have advantage on the check if you cast Containment Field during your turn.","empower":"You can choose one target creature each turn."}
