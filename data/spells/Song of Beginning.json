{"name":"Song of Beginning","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":1,"tags":["Enchantment","Forbidden (Song)","Delayed"],"cost":"9 AP","range":"Self (60 foot radius)","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You begin to sing a song about the start of a grand adventure, invigorating the spirits of your allies. If you spend at least 1 AP during your turn towards casting this spell, creatures you choose within range become inspired. Inspired creatures add 1 to every roll they make, and can survive being reduced to 0 or fewer hit points once per rest, instead being reduced to 1 hit point. The effect vanishes if creatures leave the area of the spell or if you do not spend at least 1 AP on trying to cast the spell.<br><br>When completed, you form the energy from the song into a sphere of focused magic that is flung at a location within range. Creatures in a 15 foot radius of the impact point must succeed on an Intuition saving throw or take 3d6 radiant and 3d6 psychic damage, halved on a success. Inspired creatures are unaffected.","empower":"Inspired creatures gain temporary hit points until the start of your next turn equal to your proficiency modifier times the number of AP spent."}
