You can't choose the same stat more than once. On each failure, debilitating poison floods their body, dealing 3d6 poison damage and inflicting a random condition. Roll 1d6 for each failed saving throw to determine the condition: poisoned on 1, blind on 2, frightened on 3, paralyzed on 4, petrified on 5, and unconscious on 6. All conditions inflicted this way remain until the end of your next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not afflicted with a condition.","empower":"Range increased to 90 feet."}
