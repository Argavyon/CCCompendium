{"name":"Spear of True Ice","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":7,"tags":["Evocation","Cold"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"300 feet","duration":"Until destroyed","desc":"You create and hurl a spear of true ice, freezing the air solid in a 5 foot wide, 5 foot tall line as it travels out to the spell's maximum range. Every creature in the spear's path must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d10 cold and 6d10 piercing damage and are impaled on the icy path it leaves behind. On a success, they take half damage and avoid being impaled, moving to an adjacent empty space.<br><br>The path lasts until destroyed. Each 5 foot length has AC 10 and 50 hit points, and is resistant to fire, slashing, and piercing damage and immune to cold and poison damage. Creatures impaled on it can only attack the section impaling them during their turns and can't move or take any other action. At the start of each of their turns, an impaled creature takes 2d10 cold damage.<br><br>The trail of ice can support up to two tons of weight on each 5 foot section before it starts to break, taking 10 damage at the end of each of your turns.","empower":""}
