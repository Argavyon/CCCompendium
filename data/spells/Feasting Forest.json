{"name":"Feasting Forest","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Transmutation","Plant","Delayed"],"cost":"4 AP","range":"300 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"Within a 60 foot radius centered on a target point within the area, all trees, plant life, and shrubbery that occupy at least a 5 foot cube are mutated and grow massive fangs and a grasping tongue. Each affected plant reaches out up to 10 feet towards a creature within their range, who must make their choice between a Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the tongue grabs them and pulls them adjacent to the plant, restraining them and biting down on them for 4d10 piercing damage. Any plant that did not find a target not already targeted by another plant returns to normal.<br><br>Restrained creatures can spend 2 AP to repeat the saving throw. On a success, they free themselves, and the plant returns to normal. At the end of each of their turns, they take 4d10 piercing damage while restrained. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this spell is devoured whole by the plant.","empower":"Each plant can reach up to 20 feet."}
