Everything in the original area becomes inaccessible for the duration of the spell. Any creatures remain.<br><br>The fey world is generally a wondrous place, with teal grassy plains and the occasional tree. Misty rivers can sometimes be found flowing through. In general, it is much easier to navigate the fey world than the normal world when it is transposed in this manner, as there is no difficult or hazardous terrain, and there are no walls or obstacles.<br><br>The spell does not bring over any inhabitants from the fey world. When the spell ends, the area reverts to normal, which can cause creatures to fall into hazardous terrain or be caught in walls or solid objects. Creatures in an invalid space are shunted to the nearest empty space, taking 20 damage per 5 feet moved.","empower":"Remove the Ritual function. The spell gains the Delayed function and an AP cost of 6."}
