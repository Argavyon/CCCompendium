{"name":"Necrophagic Tide","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":7,"tags":["Necromancy","Acid","Disease","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"15 minutes","desc":"You create a black, acidic ooze that occupies a 10 foot radius within range. It immediately moves up to 20 feet in a direction you choose, and any creature that it touches or moves through, or any creature that ends their turn inside, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 10d10 acid damage, halved on a success. Undead creatures take 100 acid damage instead, halved on a success. You can move it once at the beginning of each of your turns.<br><br>If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points from this damage, the ooze completely dissolves their body, then splits into a new ooze that appears within 30 feet. You move all oozes at the same time. For each ooze you control, increase the damage dealt by 1d10, or 10 against undead. A creature can only take damage from one ooze each turn.","empower":""}
