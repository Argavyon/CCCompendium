A creature that would be inside a cube of sand can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being trapped, moving to the nearest unoccupied space. Otherwise, a creature is restrained by the sand. If they are totally covered and need to breathe, they take 1d6 damage each turn, which increases by 1d6 for each turn they remain trapped. Restrained creatures can spend 2 AP to make a Strength saving throw to break free and move into an adjacent empty space on a success.<br><br>While you are concentrating on the spell, the sand remains in its location. When the spell ends, the sand disperses and is affected normally by gravity and physics, releasing any trapped creatures.","empower":"Creates 15 cubes instead."}
