You may end the spell at will anytime. When the spell ends, the recorded sounds manifest as a very small packet of air, and you have up to 1 minute to store it in an airtight container before it breaks. If stored, the packet does not break until the seal of the container is opened. When the packet breaks, the recorded sounds are released and can be heard by any nearby creatures exactly as they were recorded, as if originating from the location where the packet broke.","empower":""}
