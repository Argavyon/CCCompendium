The creature must make a Constitution saving throw now and at the start of each of your turns. On a failure, they take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned until the start of your next turn, and you are healed for half of the damage done. On a success, they take half damage and are not poisoned, and you do not receive healing.<br><br>You can't take the Attack action while concentrating on this spell. Other creatures or objects that move between you and the target block the beam, causing it to do no damage and have no effect if the beam is obstructed at the start of your turn.","empower":"Choose one - damage increased to 3d10 and becomes unholy, or healing additionally adds your spellcasting stat to the healing received, or the beam ignores obstructions."}
