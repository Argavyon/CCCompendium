{"name":"Song of Hope","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Enchantment","Forbidden (Song)","Delayed"],"cost":"9 AP","range":"Self (60 feet)","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You begin to sing a song about a young survivor finding a treasure of hope in the ruins of their kingdom. If you spend at least 1 AP during your turn towards casting this spell, peace and hope befall all creatures within range. If they take the Attack action or cast a spell that would deal damage or force a saving throw, they must make an Intuition saving throw first. On a failure, their action is canceled and they lose the AP. A creature that fails two Intuition saving throws in a row from this spell is instead charmed by you until you stop casting or they take damage. Beasts within range are immediately charmed by you and do nothing except listen to your song.<br><br>When completed, a brilliant sphere of divine energy ascends and scatters many rays of light throughout the area. Creatures you choose heal a number of hit points equal to half of their missing hit points, and have all negative spells and effects on them ended. You can choose to revive any creature that died within the area while you were casting this spell and isn't reanimated, restoring one quarter of their maximum hit points and setting them to that value. This spell mends bodily damage upon revival, such as missing limbs, but cannot affect disintegrated creatures.","empower":"Range increased to 90 feet."}
