You are hidden inside the clouds.<br><br>Any creature that tries to move into the clouds, or any creature anywhere that tries to attack you or target you with a spell, is immediately struck by lightning, taking 5d6 lightning damage. Their turn immediately ends, and their movement and action is interrupted.<br><br>You can't move or take any actions while concentrating on this spell, except to move vertically up and down the cylinder of clouds. Each time a creature is damaged, you lose 3 MP. If you can't afford the MP cost, the spell ends. If you are above the ground and can't fly when the spell ends, you fall.","empower":""}
