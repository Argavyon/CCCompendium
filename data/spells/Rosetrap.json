Each rose must be at least 10 feet apart from any other rose created by this spell. You can choose any number of creatures when casting this spell to be unaffected.<br><br>When a creature moves within 10 feet of a rose, it triggers and bursts into a mass of writhing vines, reducing the triggering creature's movement to 0 for the  turn and forcing it to stop moving. Creatures within 20 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d8 piercing damage and be restrained. Creatures that succeed take half damage and are not restrained.<br><br>A restrained creature can spend 1 AP to take 2d8 piercing damage and make a Strength saving throw. On a success, they break free from the entrapping rose. A restrained creature that takes slashing or fire damage is freed from being restrained.<br><br>The roses can be destroyed if the surface they are on is destroyed. If the rose is destroyed after being triggered, all affected creatures are freed.","empower":""}
