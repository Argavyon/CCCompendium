A creature that ingests the poison or is damaged by a poisoned weapon must make a Constitution saving throw or be affected for the duration.<br><br>Whenever a creature poisoned by lifewrack toxin spends AP, they take 4 poison damage per AP spent. Whenever a creature makes an ability check, they must first roll 1d20. On a roll of 10 or below, a coughing fit seizes them, causing them to fail the ability check automatically. <br><br>A creature can spend 2 AP and one hit die to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect early on a success. The creature still takes damage on a successful saving throw from the spent AP.","empower":""}
