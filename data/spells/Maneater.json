At the start of your next turn, it quietly blooms into an acidic, carnivorous, oversized plant that remains burrowed. The first creature to move within 10 feet of the space triggers the plant and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the plant deals 2d6 acid damage and grapples the creature. At the start of each of your turns afterwards, the plant deals 1d6 acid damage while it maintains the grapple.<br><br>The plant uses your spellcasting stat to determine its rolls when contesting grapples. If the creature breaks the grapple, the plant is torn apart and wilts immediately.<br><br>A Tiny or smaller creature reduced to 0 hit points from this spell is devoured by the plant. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points while grappled, the plant retreats back into the ground and waits for another creature. The plant is destroyed if the terrain it resides in is destroyed or forcibly changed to or from difficult terrain, or if it is in the area of a damaging spell.","empower": "You place two plants, which must be at least 15 feet away from each other.","author": "CrusaderDroid"}
