{"name":"Finality and Flame","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Evocation","Forbidden (Hellfire)","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You spend your maximum hit points instead of MP for this spell, which cannot be reduced in cost. You curse a target creature within range that you can see to a horrific fate, as obsidian flames dance along their skin. Each time they take damage while affected by this spell, one of their hit dice is destroyed. If no more hit dice are remaining, the flames seep into the creature and cause a terrible conflagration of fire in a 30 foot radius centered on the target. All creatures within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 12d12 damage, halved on a success. Half of this damage is fire, while the other half is unholy. The original target automatically fails the saving throw and has their body obliterated if reduced to 0 hit points.<br><br>The spell ends if the explosion is triggered. The affected creature can make a Willpower saving throw during their turn for 3 AP to end the spell early on a success.","empower":"Pay the empower cost in hit points instead of MP, and deduct it from your maximum hit points. You instead target up to three creatures, all of whom must be within 10 feet of each other."}
