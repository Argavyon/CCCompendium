This dust does nothing to humanoids, beasts, and constructs, but any other creature that touches the dust by moving through it or interacting with a dusted object takes 2d6 radiant damage. A creature can only suffer this damage once on each of their turns, even if it would travel through dust created by multiple applications of this spell. <br>The dust falls off of carried objects in the area, including wielded weapons.", "empower": "Area increased to 15 feet.", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
