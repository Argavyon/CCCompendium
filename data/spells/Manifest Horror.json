{"name":"Manifest Horror","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":6,"tags":["Illusion","Eldritch","Psychic","Summoning"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"300 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"Target frightened creature's horror takes form as a terrifying shapeless mass, constantly shifting through obscene forms. It appears in an adjacent space to the creature, and remains until the creature becomes unconscious or is no longer frightened, at which point the spell ends and the horror vanishes.<br><br>At the start of each of the creature's turns, the horror attacks them. They must make an Intuition saving throw or take 8d10 psychic damage, halved on a success. The horror then attempts to spread the creature's fear to all other creatures within 30 feet that are not already frightened. Each creature must make an Intuition saving throw or take 3d10 psychic damage and become frightened until the horror vanishes.<br><br>The horror imposes disadvantage on all of the target's saving throws to end the frightened condition. The first time the target creature succeeds on a saving throw while the horror is present, it is instead turned into a failure.","empower":""}
