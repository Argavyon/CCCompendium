Creatures in the area and who enter the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be dragged as close to the center as possible.<br><br>A creature that starts their turn while totally submerged must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d6 damage and have 1d4 hit dice destroyed. On a success, they take half damage and only have half the hit dice destroyed, rounded down. A creature with insufficient hit dice is vulnerable to the damage taken and has that damage deducted from maximum hit points.<br><br>The whirlpool is difficult terrain. Creatures without a swim speed must succeed on a Strength saving throw at the end of each turn while inside or be dragged back 5 feet closer to the center.<br><br>If created in water, the whirlpool's radius becomes 60 feet instead. Vehicles trapped in the center of the whirlpool take damage equal to one quarter of their maximum hit points every 6 seconds.","empower":""}
