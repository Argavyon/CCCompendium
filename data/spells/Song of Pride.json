{"name":"Song of Pride","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Enchantment","Forbidden (Song)","Delayed"],"cost":"9 AP","range":"Self (60 foot radius)","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You begin to sing a song of overconfident heroes becoming complacent in the face of danger. If you spend at least 1 AP during your turn towards casting this spell, this pride begins to seep into the area around you. Creatures you choose within range add your spellcasting stat to their attack rolls, and take additional damage from weapons and spells equal to your spellcasting stat. An unwilling creature can make an Intuition saving throw to avoid being affected each turn.<br><br>Upon completing this spell, that moment of pride sinks into the spirit of affected creatures, for better or worse. For each affected creature, they either add your spellcasting stat to their attack rolls for 1 minute, or add your spellcasting stat to the damage taken from weapons and spells for 1 minute. You choose which effect applies to them.","empower":"Reduces the AP cost by 3."}
