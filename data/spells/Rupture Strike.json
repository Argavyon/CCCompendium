The attack painfully ripples through the creature's blood and destroys a number of hit dice equal to your spellcasting stat, dealing 5 damage for each destroyed die. If there are not enough dice left, the damage for each excess die is doubled, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn.<br><br>The spell can't affect a creature without blood.","empower":""}
