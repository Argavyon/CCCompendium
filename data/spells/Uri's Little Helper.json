{"name":"Uri's Little Helper","author":"Uri de Vries","tier":2,"tags":["Enchantment","Familiar"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"touch","duration":"Until dispelled","desc":"You touch a creature, putting it in a state of blind servitude. The creature must be no bigger than a Small creature, but can be either a Beast, Fiend, Aberration, Construct or Monstrosity, and may not be of level (?) or higher. If the creature is already under control of something else, its controller must make a spellcasting check to remain control of it.<br><br>For as long the creature is yours to control, you can command it to move or use any of its abilities. It understands your words even if it could not understand your language before, and shares a telepathic bond with you to communicate.<br><br>For another 3 AP, you may amplify your control of the creature, transferring your consciousness to your familiar. You are able to sense and speak as though you were your own. For as long you do, your original body remains unconscious in a state of trance. Using an action again relinquishes the consciousness from the familiar back to you.<br><br>The spell ends when you cast it again on a new creature, or if the familiar you have dies.","empower":""}
