{"name":"Frost Regent's Monument","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Conjuration","Cold","Concentration","Delayed"],"cost":"1-9 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"For every AP spent casting this spell, you create a 5 foot tall ice pillar in a space within range you can see, or increase the size of a pillar created by this spell by 5 feet. If a creature is in a space occupied by a pillar, you can force them to either move into an adjacent empty space or be carried upward on top of the pillar. Pillars block movement and can't be destroyed.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, you can use 1 AP to cause a pillar to launch shards of ice at up to three target creatures within 30 feet of the pillar. Make a magic attack roll. On a hit, a shard deals 1d8 piercing damage and 1d8 cold damage plus your spellcasting stat. The pillar then shrinks by 1 foot. A pillar that has shrunk to 4 or fewer feet no longer obstructs movement, and a pillar that has shrunk to 0 feet is destroyed.<br><br>You can attack with this spell any number of times during your turn, as long as you attack with a different pillar each time.","empower":"You can attack an additional target with each pillar."}
