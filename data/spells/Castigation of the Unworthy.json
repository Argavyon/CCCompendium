On a successful saving throw, they take half damage.<br><br>On each of your successive turns, you can spend 1 AP once per turn to strike the same target again, forcing them to repeat the saving throw. Each time you do, the damage increases by 2d6.<br><br>A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell falls to the ground screaming, surrounded by an unnatural field that protects them from all harm while tormenting them with their sins.
