On a success, they lose 2 AP during their next turn as they reel from the sudden mental assault, and can't be targeted by this spell again until they complete a rest. On a failure, you quickly suborn their mind and implant a condition and a command. The condition can be any event you desire, or any passage of time you desire, while the command can be anything the creature can achieve within one turn, including movement, multiple uses of AP, or known spells. The creature is then stunned until the end of their next turn.<br><br>For the next 15 minutes, if the condition becomes true, the creature immediately interrupts the current turn to take its command. The spell then ends. The creature is aware of the actions they took, but not that you were the one who cast the spell on them.<br><br>You can cast this spell over 1 minute on the target creature. If you do so, the duration extends to 24 hours.<br><br>The spell can't target creatures immune to being charmed.","empower":"The creature gains 3 additional AP when deciding what command it should take."}
