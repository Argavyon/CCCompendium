It is ethereal and immune to harm.<br><br>The hound remains within 10 feet of where it was summoned at all times. It can be told to watch for creatures or events of any criteria you specify, such as \"the man with the six-fingered hand\" or \"a source of fire\". You can adjust these criteria at any time without requiring an action. If the hound sees anything within 60 feet that fits the criteria, it barks loudly enough to be heard within 300 feet, telepathically notifying you.<br><br>The hound has unerringly true vision. If something that fits the chosen criteria would be hidden to it due to magic, its barks dispel the effect.", "empower": "", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
