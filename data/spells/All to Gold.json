{"name":"All to Gold","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Transmutation","Acid","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Self (30 foot cone)","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You spray an alchemical compound in a 30 foot cone. Objects struck by this cone turn to gold. Creatures hit must make a Constitution saving throw or be transformed into gold. On a successful saving throw, they instead take 4d6 acid damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, their equipment is affected.<br><br>Golden objects and creatures can't move or take action and have a damage reduction of -5. Affected weapons deal 1 damage on hit instead of their normal damage dice, and affected armor has its AC set to 10. An affected creature that is damaged can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn to end the effect early on a success. Magical objects that are affected revert to normal at the end of your next turn.<br><br>If the spell ends without losing concentration, creatures with 5 or fewer total hit dice as well as objects still affected are permanently transformed into gold. Gold created this way is visibly marked - a DC 10 Knowledge ability check reveals it is magically created.","empower":"Choose one - cone size increased to 45 feet, or deals 6d6 acid damage on a failed Constitution saving throw and half as much on a success, or the spell instead gains a range of 60 feet, targets a 30 foot cube, and only affects objects and equipment."}
