On a failed save, for the next minute that creature freely speaks every thought they have without noticing they are thinking out loud. These thoughts are in the primary language of the affected creature. If the creature cannot speak any language this spell fails.<br><br>If an affected creature notices at any point that another creature nearby has heard one of their thoughts, they will believe that they misspoke, and this spell immediately ends. A creature that succeeds on the initial Willpower save, or for whom this spell has ended, cannot be affected again for 1 day.","empower":""}
