{"name":"Gate of Purgation","author":"Levi","tier":4,"tags":["Abjuration","Fire","Holy","Delayed","Sign"],"cost":"6 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"Ethereal white flames fill the air in a 30 foot radius and 30 foot high cylinder rising from target point. The flames provide bright light in the area and cast dim light out to a radius of an additional 90 feet.<br><br>For Undead, Fiends, and Urthings, or any creature whose body is inhabited by a soul or other external consciousness that is not their original, the flames cause intense debilitating pain. When one of these creatures enters or touches the flames for the first time on each of their turns, they immediately lose concentration, their AP is lowered by 3, and their movement is lowered by half of their speed. Additionally the flames are difficult terrain for these creatures, and these creatures cannot gain HP, temporary HP, MP, AP, or additional movement as long as they are touching the flames.<br><br>For any other creature, touching the flames gives them advantage on saving throws against all magical effects as long as they are touching the flames.<br><br>While inside the area, your Fire and Holy spells apply the effects of being touched by this spell's purifying flames to targets hit until the start of their next turn.<br><br>Note: I wrote Tier 4 but it might be worth much more than that in certain circumstances, so idk.","empower":""}
