Creatures within 10' of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d4 radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. If this hits at least one creature, you can cause a second star to drop on a different point within 60' of the first point, but it must be at least 10' away from the first point.","empower":""}
