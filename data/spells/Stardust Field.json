{"name":"Stardust Field","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":2,"tags":["Conjuration","Space"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"120 feet","duration":"15 minutes","desc":"You pull a small section of a nebula into a 30 foot radius sphere. It is gorgeous, yet incredibly thick, preventing vision through it and blinding creatures inside of it. It remains for the duration, and is too heavy to blow away with Wind spells.<br><br>Creatures that are not engaged in combat that see the nebula are enamored by it. Creatures without hit dice are compelled to admire it until it ends or they are damaged. Creatures with hit dice must succeed on an Intuition saving throw to avoid doing nothing except admiring it until they take damage or it ends or another creature spends 1 AP to shake them. A creature that made this saving throw can repeat it once per minute to end its enthralling effect on itself.","empower":"Radius increased to 50 feet. Disables blindsight and other senses inside and through the nebula."}
