It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4d12 radiant damage and becomes marred through the intense light, becoming vulnerable to your choice of slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage until the end of your next turn. A creature that is immune to a damage type cannot be vulnerable, but a resistance is replaced with a vulnerability. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and does not gain a vulnerability.","empower":"Choose one - Damage increased to 6d12, or you can choose any non-radiant damage type to bestow a vulnerability, or you affect an additional target."}
