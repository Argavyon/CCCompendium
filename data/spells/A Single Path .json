Over the course of an hour, you walk a path, entering this space at one point and leaving at another, which is determined to be the 'Correct' path. Any creature who enters the space afterwards who does not follow the 'Correct' path will find themselves back at the entry point. A creature subject to this effect may make a Knowledge save to notice something amiss. If they succeed at this save, they may make a Knowledge save to ignore the effect. Both saves can be made each time a creature finds itself at the entry point.","empower":""}
