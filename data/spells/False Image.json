The image can be anything you choose, although it is restricted only to visual imagery and cannot replicate sound, touch, smell, or taste.<br><br>If you have the Illusion tag, you can also create a sound that accompanies the image. The sound can repeat for the full duration, or start and stop after a set time.<br><br>The image does not hold up to scrutiny. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a Knowledge saving throw. On a success, it detects the illusion, which appears as transparent to them for the duration. A creature that physically interacts with the illusion automatically makes and succeeds on this saving throw.", "empower": ""}
