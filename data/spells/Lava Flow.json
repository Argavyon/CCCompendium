This lava is magical, an imitation of true lava, and is missing most of the lethal heat.<br><br>The lava counts as difficult terrain for any creature not immune to fire damage. Any creature that makes contact with it or starts their turn inside of it takes 2d6 fire damage and becomes vulnerable to the next source of fire damage before the start of their next turn. Flammable objects in or within 5 feet of the lava burst into flames.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, the lava flows an additional 10 feet forward. You can choose to adjust the direction of the flow up to forty-five degrees each time.<br><br>After 1 minute, the flow stops expanding. After 1 hour, the flow disappears.","empower":"Damage increased to 4d6."}
