{"name":"Phantom Self","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":6,"tags":["Illusion","Spirit","Concentration"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self","duration":"1 hour","desc":"You split your spirit off from yourself, allowing you to be in two places at once. You share movement between your corporeal body and your spirit body - if you have 30 feet movement speed, for instance, your spirit body can move 20 feet and your corporeal body can move 10 feet during your turn. Your spirit body can move through objects and walls. Your spirit body counts as you for the purposes of all talents and features that affect an area around you, but it can't attack or cast spells.<br><br>You can spend 2 AP to switch your corporeal body and spirit body's locations. If your spirit body would take damage, it harmlessly passes through, but prevents you from using this action until after the end of your turn. If your normal body would take damage, you can spend 1 AP to switch places as a response.","empower":""}
