You gain 1 AP at the end of each of your turns, usable only for responses granted by this spell. When a creature moves within 10 feet of you or makes a melee attack against you, you can spend 1 AP as a response to have your shadow reach out and touch the creature. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 cold damage and have their movement speed set to 0 until the end of their turn. A successful saving throw inflicts half damage and reduces their movement speed by 10 feet instead.","empower":"You gain 2 AP instead."}
