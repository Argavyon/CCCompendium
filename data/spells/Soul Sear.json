{"name": "Soul Sear", "tier": 1, "tags": ["Necromancy", "Unholy"], "cost": "1-3 AP", "range": "90 feet", "duration": "Instantaneous", "desc": "A ghostly beam of dark magic extends from your palm to a creature you can sense, passing through all other objects and creatures. The target creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 unholy damage, plus 1d6 unholy damage for each AP spent past the first. If cast for 3 AP, a creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this spell has their soul burned out of their body, leaving behind a body perfect for future use. Casting a Necromancy spell on such a body refunds half the MP cost used for the spell.", "empower": "Damage increased by 1d6. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage. If cast for 3 AP, additionally prevents a creature that failed the saving throw from healing any hit points until the start of your next turn.", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
