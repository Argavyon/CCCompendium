{"name":"Soul Sear","tier":1,"tags":["Necromancy","Unholy"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"90 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"A ghostly beam of dark magic extends from your palm to a creature you can sense, passing through all other objects and creatures. The target creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 unholy damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this spell has their soul burned out of their body, leaving behind a body perfect for future use. Casting a Necromancy spell on such a body refunds half the MP cost used for the spell.","empower":""}
