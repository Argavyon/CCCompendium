They can't be moved by any outside force, and gain resistance to physical damage. Objects also become immune to other spells. Creatures have their AP reduced to 1 for the duration. Unwilling creatures can make a Constitution saving throw to avoid the effect, and can repeat it at the end of each of their turns to end the effect early.", "empower": "", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
