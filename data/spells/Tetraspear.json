{"name":"Tetraspear","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Conjuration","Earth"],"cost":"1 to 3 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You target one point within range you can see, plus one more point for each AP spent on the spell. With a gesture, a thick earthen spear suddenly juts out of each point, rising to 10 feet tall and occupying the space completely. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage. Any creature on the point has disadvantage on the saving throw and is displaced to an adjacent empty space of your choice. A successful saving throw halves the damage, but still displaces creatures. A creature can only take damage from one spear.<br><br>The affected area around each spear becomes difficult terrain. The spears have AC 10 and 15 hit points.","empower":"Choose one - damage increased to 5d12, or create two additional spears, or radius increases to 15 feet."}
