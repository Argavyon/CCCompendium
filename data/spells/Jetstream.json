All creatures caught in the windblast must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d6 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Regardless, all creatures hit are forcibly moved out of the path of air current if possible. All objects struck by the windblast take twice as much damage. The windblast stops on the first object it strikes that it does not destroy, if it encounters one.<br><br>The violent air current created remains until the start of your next turn. Creatures cannot enter the wind current except from its origin point. Creatures may enter the wind current from its origin point to immediately move to the end point of the wind current without consuming movement. This movement can occur even if the air current crosses an area with no ground underneath it.<br><br>When cast at a higher tier, the range of this spell doubles for every tier above 4.","empower":""}
