{"name":"Tornado","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Evocation","Wind"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"90 feet ","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You create a tornado centered on target point within range that you can see, with a radius of 5, 10, or 15 feet, and a height of 30, 60, or 90 feet. The spell fails if the tornado has no room to reach its full size. When you cast this spell, designate a direction across the ground for the tornado to move in. <br><br>Whenever any creature or object touches the tornado and can be fully contained inside of it, including when the tornado is created, they are swept up and flung 30 feet in a random direction. If they collide with an object or creature, they stop moving, land in the nearest adjacent empty space, and take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. The blocking object or creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage, halved on a success.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, the tornado moves 10 feet in the designated direction.","empower":"Size can be increased to a 20 foot radius and a 120 foot height."}
