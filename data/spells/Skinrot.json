{"name":"Skinrot","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":6,"tags":["Necromancy","Disease","Mastery"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"Up to 3 creatures within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they become afflicted with skinrot, a debilitating disease that causes skin to slough off on any physical contact harder than a shove. Whenever the creature takes damage from a weapon attack, they lose one hit die and take additional poison damage equal to one roll of that hit die. All damage from weapons they suffer while affected is deducted from their maximum hit points.<br><br>Creatures that have no skin or cannot be poisoned are immune to this spell. Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw on the end of each of their turns to end the effect early on a success.","empower":"Affects two additional targets."}
