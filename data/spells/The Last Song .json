If you spend at least 1 AP during your turn towards casting this spell, all creatures within range must succeed on a Intuition save or join the chorus. Creatures who have joined the chorus must spend 1 AP towards finishing The Last Song until either they are incapacitated or the spell is finished.   If creatures leave the area of the spell, they are treated as an extension of your casting until the spell ends. If you do not spend at least 1 AP on trying to cast the spell, the spell ends.<br><br>When completed, everything living in earshot of the sound begins to slowly crumble to nothing. All living things within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or begin deteriorating, taking 10d12 damage on a success. Deteriorating creatures take 1d12 damage every hour. Each time they take damage from any source, Deteriorating creatures force all living things within 60ft to make the same save. Deteriorating can only be removed from individual creatures by dispelling.","empower":""}
