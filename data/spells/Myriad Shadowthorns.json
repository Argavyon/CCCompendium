{"name":"Myriad Shadowthorns","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":8,"tags":["Illusion","Shadow","Concentration"],"cost":"1 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You create a 30 foot long, 1 foot wide wall of transparent shadows, extending upwards as far as the eye can see. When a projectile crosses the shadow, four thorns made of shadows appear inside the wall, close to the point of impact.<br><br>For 1 AP during each of your turns, you can either reposition the wall somewhere else within range, or choose to fire all collected thorns, targeting one creature per thorn. Creatures must make an Intuition saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage per thorn targeting them, to a maximum of 16d6 damage. A successful saving throw deals half damage.","empower":""}
