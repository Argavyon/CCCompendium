For each AP spent to cast this spell you spawn one vine.<br><br>Each vine can be commanded to coil around one creature in range that is within 60 feet of the ground. A targeted creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become prone and restrained. An airborne creature caught by a vine is pulled down to the ground, suffering fall damage as necessary. Vines that miss their target retreat into the ground harmlessly. A creature restrained by this spell may repeat the save at the start of each of their turns to attempt to free themselves. Alternatively if a vine is destroyed, the restrained creature is freed. Vines have 10 AC, 20 HP, and a restrained creature has disadvantage on attacking the vines restraining them.<br><br>While this spell lasts, you may repeat the cast effect once on each of your turns at no additional MP cost, paying 1-3 AP each time, to spawn more vines.","empower":""}
