{"name":"Bloodvine Seeding","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Conjuration","Plant"],"cost":"1 to 3 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"For every AP spent, you fire two seeds, each aimed at a creature within range. A creature targeted by at least one seed must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage per seed. The seeds embed themselves in creatures that fail their saving throw.<br><br>At any time between the start of your next turn and the end of this spell, you can spend 1 AP to have any number of seeds erupt into a tangle of grasping vines. The victim takes 2d6 piercing damage per seed, and the vines reach out to the nearest creature within 10 feet. If a creature is within range, the vines grapple both their host and the creature, and they remain grappled until either of them spends 2 AP to make a Strength saving throw that destroys them on a success, or until the vines take 20 damage.<br><br>If you would be grappled by vines, you instead heal for 4 hit points per seed in the target.","empower":"Choose one - number of seeds per AP increases to three, or vine range increases to 20 feet, or healing increased to 6 hit points per seed."}
