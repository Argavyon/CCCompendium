They must make a Dexterity saving throw for each wave or take 3d8 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn. A successful saving throw deals half damage and does not poison, while a failed saving throw automatically fails all successive saving throws.","empower":"Choose one: radius increased to 90 feet, or add a fourth wave."}
