The brown bear gains temporary hit points each turn equal to two times your spellcasting stat and adds your spellcasting stat to all of its attack and damage rolls against that target as long as the target has more than 0 hit points. It takes its turn after yours and obeys your mental commands, but cannot attack any creature other than the focused target.<br><br>You can spend 3 AP to change the focused target to a new creature within range, reduced to 2 AP if the prior target has been reduced to 0 hit points or is no longer in range.<br><br>The bear vanishes when the spell ends or it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.","empower":"Removes the Concentration tag from this spell. Casting this spell again causes the previous bear to vanish."}
