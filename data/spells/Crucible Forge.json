This field is indestructible and prevents movement as well as attacks and spells through the field. An unwilling creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being encased in the field.<br><br>The field superheats the area inside, forcibly burning away impurities. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failure and half damage on a success. Any conditions on the creature are ended. The creature can use its action to make a Willpower saving throw to break free of the field, ending the field on a success.<br><br>When the field ends, either as the result of a successful Willpower saving throw, or when you choose to end it for 0 AP at any time, the creature within is forged in body and spirit. For each time it took damage from the spell, the creature heals 2d12 hit points and gains 1 AP. This bonus AP remains until the end of the creature's next turn.","empower":""}
