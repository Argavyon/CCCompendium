{"name":"Wall of Snow","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Conjuration","Cold","Concentration","Delayed"],"cost":"9 AP","range":"90 feet","duration":"8 hours","desc":"For each AP spent on this spell, you create two massive piles of snow that each occupy an area 10 foot long, 5 foot wide, and 15 feet tall. Each pile must be adjacent to at least one other pile.<br><br>The snow is thick enough to prevent movement and block sight and projectiles through it. Creatures in the area when it is created must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be buried in the snow, restraining them if they are small enough to be completely contained by the snow. Creatures restrained this way take 3d6 cold damage at the start of each of their turns and can use 2 AP to make a Strength saving throw to break free and move into an adjacent empty space on a success. If a creature succeeds on the Dexterity saving throw, they move to the nearest empty space of your choice.<br><br>Creatures can climb on the snow normally. If they fall through the snow for whatever reason, they become restrained as if they failed the Dexterity saving throw. Other creatures can use 3 AP to dig out adjacent restrained creatures. Fire damage causes a 5 foot cube of snow to melt, once per pile per attack.<br><br>You can cast this spell early, without gathering the maximum amount of AP.","empower":"The snow piles increase to 25 feet tall and 10 feet wide. You summon an additional pile per AP spent."}
