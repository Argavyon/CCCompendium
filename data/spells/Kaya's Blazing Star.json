You must have a line of sight to the point (creatures and difficult terrain do not count as obscuring your sight), and the maximum distance to the point is twice your remaining movement speed for the turn. Every creature between yourself and your destination must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage and 1d6 bludgeoning damage. On a success, they only take 1d6 Radiant damage. <br><br>If the target location is occupied, the creature occupying the space must also make a Dexterity throw; if they fail, they take 2d6 radiant damage, 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and are also pushed 5 feet into an adjacent square and knocked prone. On a success, they take 2d6 radiant damage.<br><br>You are moved to the target location, consuming your remaining movement for the turn. This movement does not trigger attacks of opportunity, and ignores difficult terrain.","empower":"All creatures within a 5 foot radius of the target point must make a Dexterity save or take 2d6 radiant damage, 2d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone, and any creature at the exact target point has disadvantage on their Dexterity save."}
