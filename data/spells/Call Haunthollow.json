{"name":"Call Haunthollow","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Necromancy","Plant","Summoning","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"15 minutes","desc":"You call forth an ashen, pale tree that occupies a 10 foot radius, 20 foot tall cylinder at target location you can see. This tree has no greenery, but a hollow in the center of the tree emits an unearthly wailing that causes the infinite ashen vines within to shake and rattle.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, the haunthollow sends a vine out to a creature corpse within 60 feet of it and reanimates the creature under its control. At the end of each of your turns, the haunthollow commands each creature to move up to half its movement speed and optionally make one weapon attack. You choose where each creature moves and who each creature attacks.<br><br>If no corpses are within range, the haunthollow instead launches a vine at whatever creature is in range with the lowest hit point count. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 unholy damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this damage is instantly reanimated.<br><br>The haunthollow has AC 12 and 120 hit points. Its vines have AC 12, 10 hit points and are vulnerable to slashing, fire and radiant damage. Destroying a vine immediately ends the reanimation effect on that creature. Destroying the haunthollow ends the spell.<br><br>If your concentration is broken, the haunthollow no longer regards you as an ally or obeys your commands, and will command reanimated creatures to defend itself and attack the nearest living creature to itself.","empower":""}
