{"name":"Mastery of the Road","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Transmutation","Earth","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Self","duration":"8 hours","desc":"The earth itself becomes a road for you. You and all creatures within 30 feet are moved 30 feet at the start of each of your turns in a chosen direction. This movement is almost imperceptible, as if everyone was always at the new location to begin with. This movement never allows response attacks, and creatures moving this way do not activate effects that trigger when moving into certain spaces.<br><br>The spell continues even if you are unable to move, are resting, or are working on another task. It does not interrupt breaks or rests.<br><br>The spell ends if you move into a space you have already moved through before during the spell.","empower":"Choose one - movement increased to 45 feet, or radius increased to 45 feet, or remove Concentration from this spell."}
