{"name":"Star Pollination","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":7,"tags":["Necromancy","Eldritch","Plant","Space","Wind"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"300 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"Winds from unknown realms come forth and spread the seeds of up to five stars. You choose a target point or creature within range that you can see to serve as the bed for each seed.<br><br>A chosen creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the seed. On a success, the seed instead plants itself in an adjacent empty space you choose.<br><br>At the start of your next turn, the seeds begin to bloom, turning into magnificent star flowers that burn without heat and continue to grow. Each star flower occupies a 5 foot radius sphere, shedding bright light out to 15 feet. Any creature in the light of at least one star at the start of their turns must succeed on a saving throw using their lowest stat or take 4d6 arcane damage, halved on a success. The damage increases by 2d6 each time they have to make this saving throw before the spell ends. Creatures that are used as seed beds have the star flower emerge from their body, and it moves with them as they move.<br><br>The stars drink up magic. Whenever any creature within the light of a star casts a spell, that star grows, expanding its radius by 5 feet and its light by 15 feet.<br><br>At the end of the spell, every star explodes, scattering stellar pollen into the area where its light touched that sticks to any creature that touches it. The area and any creature covered in the pollen remain illuminated for 8 hours, and creatures affected by the pollen become vulnerable to arcane damage for the duration.","empower":""}
