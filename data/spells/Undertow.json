If it appears in front of you, it rushes out in a 90 foot long line. Otherwise, the wave rushes towards you and stops before it touches you.<br><br>Creatures caught in the wave must make a Strength saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be dragged 15 feet in the direction of the wave. A creature that succeeds takes half damage and is not moved. Objects that completely fit within the wave are dragged 15 feet as well. An object moved into the same space as a creature knocks the creature prone.","empower":"You can start the wave at any point along the line in either direction."}
