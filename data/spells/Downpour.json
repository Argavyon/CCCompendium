The rain counts as difficult terrain, and any location with more than one foot of water inside is difficult terrain for creatures without a swim speed.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to move the rain to a new location. After you choose to move it or not, another foot of water builds up on the area.<br><br>Water from this spell is not magical and remains after the spell ends. It is not potable, and does not necessarily remain in the area it fell in, spreading out to adjacent areas as normal water would.","empower":"Choose one - area increased to 30 foot square, or three feet of water pour out each turn."}
