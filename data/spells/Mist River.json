{"name":"Mist River","tier":1,"tags":["Conjuration","Water","Fey","Concentration"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You create a flowing river 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, with the midpoint being anywhere within range. You can shape the river however you like as long as the path of the river does not overlap with itself.<br><br>The river is difficult terrain. It emanates thick mist that covers a 15 foot wide, 10 foot tall line centered on the river, which heavily obscures vision inside and through the mist. The mist can be dispelled by a strong wind, but at the start of each of your turns, the mist returns. When the spell ends, both river and mist disappear.","empower":"Range increases to 60 feet. Length increases to 60 feet."}
