The creature is shoved 5 feet away from you, taking 4d6 force damage from crashing through the barrier, and the creature always lands prone from the shock of passing through through shattering barrier. The portal then promptly closes behind them.<br><br>If for some reasons unknown the target is willing to be thrown through the portal, you may choose to deal  no damage to the target and not force them to land prone as the barrier shatters harmlessly.","empower":"Spacetime warps, you no longer need an open space behind your target, and may select the target destination of the target creature to be any open space you can see within 30 feet of you."}
