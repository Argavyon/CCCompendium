Any creatures inside must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are frozen solid. On a success, they move to the nearest empty space out of range.<br><br>Frozen creatures take 5d10 cold damage instead of taking a turn. Damage taken this way bypasses temporary hit points. They gain 50 temporary hit points and a vulnerability to fire damage. If their temporary hit points are reduced to 0, the ice breaks and they can take turns normally.<br><br>Creatures immune to cold damage are immune to this spell.","empower":"Choose one - damage increased to 8d10, or radius increased to 20 feet, or temporary hit points increased to 125."}
