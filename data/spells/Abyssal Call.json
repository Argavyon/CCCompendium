The spell fails if you cast it in a location that cannot fit the creature. It has AC 18, and 200 hit points, and cannot receive healing. It automatically succeeds on all saving throws. While it has at least one hit point, you have resistance to all damage taken, and the creature takes damage equal to the damage you take.<br><br>You and the creature can move anywhere within the pool of water during your turn, but cannot leave the water. You can spend 1 AP to make a tentacle attack, 2 AP to make two tentacle attacks, and 3 AP to make one tentacle attack on all creatures within 10 feet of you. The tentacle attack has a reach of 10 feet, uses your spellcasting stat to determine attack and damage bonuses, deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit, and grapples the target on a hit. You can only grapple one creature with each attack, no matter how many creatures you hit. At the start of each of your turns, grappled creatures take 2d10 bludgeoning damage.<br><br>The spell ends when you or the creature have been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.", "empower": "", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
