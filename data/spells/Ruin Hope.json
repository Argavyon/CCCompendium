{"name":"Ruin Hope","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Enchantment","Forbidden (Ruin)","Silent","Still"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"120 feet","duration":"8 hours","desc":"You attempt to crush the hope in a creature so thoroughly that they lose faith in their original goals and align themselves to you out of depression and hopelessness. The target must make an Intuition saving throw. On a failure, they become charmed by you for the duration, and align themselves with your goals. You can't control them, but they will generally fight for you against their former allies. This may not necessarily cause the creature to take up arms directly - depending on the creature, they may simply choose not to act against you, or provide information in lieu of direct combat support.<br><br>At the end of the duration, the creature repeats the saving throw if they are within 120 feet of you. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the spell is extended for 8 more hours. A creature not within 120 feet at the end of the duration is no longer affected by the spell. A creature that is affected for 24 hours by this spell has its effects become permanent, even if they leave the range of the spell.","empower":""}
