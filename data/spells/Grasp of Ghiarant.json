Each portal attempts to latch onto one creature of your choice within range, who must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become grappled by the portal. On a success, you can choose a new target for the portal at the start of each of your turns.<br><br>A creature grappled by the tendrils takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns and must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the start of their next turn. It can break the grapple as normal, and you treat the portal's Strength as equal to your spellcasting stat plus 2 for the purpose of this roll. <br><br>At the start of your turns, grappled creatures are pulled 10 feet closer to the portal, increased to 20 feet if they are restrained. A creature that would be pulled through the portal while having more than 0 hit points takes an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage.<br><br>A creature reduced to 0 hit points while grappled by this spell is pulled through the portal to an indescribable fate. Their body cannot be retrieved by any means.","empower":"Creates a third portal 5 feet above you."}
