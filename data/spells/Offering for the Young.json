On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage and is not restrained, and the spell immediately ends.<br><br>A creature restrained by this spell is subject to a unique poison that turns them into a brooding ground for spiders. At the start of each of their turns, they must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d12 poison damage, halved on a success. At the end of each of their turns while restrained, they can make a Strength saving throw to break free on a success, but this does not stop the poison damage by itself. A creature that succeeds at two consecutive Constitution saving throws against this spell ends the spell early.<br><br>A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell has spiders burst from their body, including one spider that rapidly accelerates in growth to a giant spider. It obeys your mental commands loyally until death.","empower":"Creates two giant spiders instead."}
