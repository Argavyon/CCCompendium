{"name":"Field of Stasis","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Abjuration","Cold","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Self (10 foot radius)","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You create a 10 foot sphere centered on yourself that moves with you. This sphere is filled with cold magic so intense that it seeps into everything inside. Projectiles, weapon attacks, and spells cast from outside the sphere stop at the sphere's edge and fail to affect anyone inside, and creatures inside can't gain or lose hit points. If a creature would move into the sphere's space when it is not your turn, they are briefly frozen in place and end their movement and their turn, if applicable, immediately.<br><br>Even though you can't lose hit points while inside the sphere, you must still make concentration saving throws when hit by attacks.","empower":"Radius increases to 20 feet. You can shrink or expand the radius to any amount between 5 and 20 feet once during each of your turns."}
