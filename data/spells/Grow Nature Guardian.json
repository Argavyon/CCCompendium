{"name":"Grow Nature Guardian","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":9,"tags":["Transmutation","Plant","Summoning","Delayed"],"cost":"6 AP","range":"30 feet","duration":"Until destroyed","desc":"You infuse life and intellect into a massive amount of plant matter and create a nature guardian - a towering being devoted to the protection of nature.<br><br>The nature guardian takes a shape you choose, but is always Gargantuan size, displacing everything in its tiles into the nearest adjacent empty tiles upon being summoned. It has AC 24 and 400 hit points, and uses your spellcasting stat for all of its own stats. Beasts and plants within 1 mile are permanently charmed by it.<br><br>The nature guardian takes its turn after yours. It is not under your control. If a creature it can see damages a beast or plant, or destroys terrain, it becomes enraged and targets that creature. It can use 1 AP to lash out with a vine as a weapon attack to deal 4d20 bludgeoning damage on a hit. It can use 2 AP to slam down and send a wave of greenery in a 60 foot wide, 120 foot long line that transforms the terrain into difficult terrain, which requires creatures in this range to make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d20 bludgeoning damage and be restrained until the end of their next turn, and take half damage and not be restrained on a success. It can cast any Plant spell of tier 7 or lower that you know, ignoring MP costs. It has a movement speed of 20 feet.<br><br>You can't cast this spell again until the first nature guardian is destroyed.","empower":""}
