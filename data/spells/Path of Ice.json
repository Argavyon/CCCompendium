Upon reaching the desired location, it freezes solid. Creatures in the path must make a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained and take 6d6 cold damage. A creature that succeeds takes half damage and moves out of the way of the path into the closest empty space.<br><br>The path remains for the duration of the spell. Each 5 foot square has 10 hit points, AC 10, and vulnerability to fire and bludgeoning damage, and shatters if its hit points are reduced to 0. A creature restrained by the spell can make a weapon attack against the nearest square, freeing itself if the square is destroyed.","empower": "Destroyed squares are restored at the start of each of your turns.","author": "CrusaderDroid"}
