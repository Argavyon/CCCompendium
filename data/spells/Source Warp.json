You may choose to either purify the water, completely removing any poisons, disease, and magical effects in it, or corrupt the water, fundamentally changing its properties. <br><br>If you choose to corrupt the water, you must have another liquid on hand to use as reference. This spell consumes the liquid to transmute a volume of water up to 10x the amount of liquid consumed. For the duration, the affected water has all the non-magical properties of the reference liquid, though on inspection it remains normal water.","empower":"Corrupt effect lasts 1 day instead."}
