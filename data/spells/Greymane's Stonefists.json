{"name":"Greymane's Stonefists","author":"Argavyon","tier":2,"tags":["Transmutation","Earth"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You transform your fists into large stone hands. If your species does not have hands, you instead create two floating stone hands near your front limbs. They are too inflexible to use to wield weapons. Each fist does 2d10 damage on a hit, and uses either your Strength or spellcasting stat to determine their attack and damage bonuses. Your fists do 20 damage to objects made of stone or ice.<br><br>The fists grant you increased power to carry and destroy objects. You can punch a space to transform it into difficult terrain, or clear out difficult terrain with one strike, for 1 AP. Your carrying capacity is tripled so long as you can hold the objects with your fists. Grappled creatures have disadvantage on rolls to break free of the grapple.","empower":"Duration becomes one hour."}
