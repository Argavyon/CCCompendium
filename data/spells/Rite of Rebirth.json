The exact species is randomly chosen. It keeps any prior class levels and talents. It may choose new traits, if applicable. It loses access to all species features and talents it had before, and gains its new species' features, as well as an equivalent amount of species talents according to its class levels, if applicable.<br><br>If the ritual is interrupted, the target's body is dissolved by the water.", "empower": "", "author": "CrusaderDroid"}
