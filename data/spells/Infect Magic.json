{"name":"Infect Magic","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Abjuration","Arcane","Disease","Poison"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You attempt to infect the connection between a spell effect with concentration and the spellcaster. You choose either the spell effect itself or a creature affected by the spell effect and target that effect. Its caster must make a saving throw using its spellcasting stat. On a failure, your infection overrides their control of the spell. For the duration of this spell, the original owner can no longer willingly end the spell. At the start of each of their turns, if their spell is still active, they take 3d10 poison damage, ignoring resistance and immunity, and have one hit die destroyed. If there are no more hit dice, the creature is vulnerable to the damage taken.<br><br>The creature makes Concentration saves as normal when damaged by other creatures or effects, but if they fail, their spell does not end. Instead, they take the same damage they would normally take at the start of their turn.<br><br>An affected creature can spend 2 AP to repeat the saving throw. On a success, both this spell and their concentrated spell end.","empower":""}
