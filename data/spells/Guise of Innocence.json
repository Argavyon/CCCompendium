Misdeeds are instantly forgiven, and any who express anger at the target become scorned by all others.<br><br>Egregious crimes, such as murder or theft of an ancient artifact, cause witnesses to make an Intuition saving throw. On a success, they are no longer affected by the spell. On a failure, they rationalize away the crime. A creature that witnesses two such crimes automatically succeeds on the saving throw.<br><br>This spell does not have any effect on creatures immune to being charmed.","empower":""}
