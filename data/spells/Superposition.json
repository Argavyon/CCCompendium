If used in combat, the two bodies have their own movement speed, though they share your turn. The phantom images are both considered your true body, and share their senses with each other. Due to their uncertain and illusory nature, the phantom images have advantage on skill checks to perceive their surroundings or to hide their presence. Their existence is so thin that creatures more than 30 feet away cannot detect them with non-magical senses.<br><br>If at any point during this spell's duration, another creature becomes aware of one of your phantom images or the two bodies move out of range of each other the spell ends early. When the spell ends, you must choose one of the two bodies to be your true body, and the other phantom image dissipates into nonexistence as probability collapses onto that body and its actions being the true line of reality.<br><br>**Empower:** The range of this spell becomes Self (1 mile).","empower":""}
