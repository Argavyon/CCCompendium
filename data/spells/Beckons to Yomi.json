On a failure, they are transported into the afterlife of your choice and removed from the current plane for the duration. Choose one of two effects for the creature:<br><br>Heaven: The creature heals itself of all conditions, and heals 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. For every 30 hit points healed this way, they recover one hit die.<br>Hell: The creature has two hit dice destroyed at the start of each of its turns. If it has no more hit dice remaining, it instead loses 30 maximum hit points.<br><br>Creatures in hell can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect early on a success. When the spell ends, the target reappears at their prior location. Creatures sent to heaven can't be targeted by this spell again until they complete a rest.","empower":"Reduces the AP cost to 3."}
