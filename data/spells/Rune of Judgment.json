{"name":"Rune of Judgment","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":5,"tags":["Transmutation","Forbidden (Rune)"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Touch","duration":"1 hour","desc":"You inscribe a rune on an object that covers at least a 5 foot cube. When you do so, choose any number of creatures to be exempt from its effects.<br><br>When a creature within 60 feet of the rune starts their turn, they must make a Willpower saving throw. On a failure, the weight of judgment falls upon them - if they damage a creature during their turn, they take 3d10 damage and immediately end their turn, losing all remaining AP. This damage can't be reduced or negated.<br><br>If the object is destroyed or if the rune is scratched out by an adjacent creature for 2 AP, the spell ends.<br><br>You can only inscribe one such rune. Inscribing a new rune of this type destroys all existing runes of this type.","empower":"The object gains resistance to damage. It takes 6 AP to scratch out the rune."}
