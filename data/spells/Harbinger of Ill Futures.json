{"name":"Harbinger of Ill Futures","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Conjuration","Disease","Earth","Poison","Radiant","Apocalyptic","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"30 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You summon a humanoid-shaped mass of rocks, each of which is imbued with a sickly green core. It shines this pale light out to 30 feet.<br><br>Creatures that start their turn in the light lose 1d6 maximum hit points and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are poisoned, and lose 3d6 maximum hit points for each turn they start in range while poisoned in this way. A creature can repeat the saving throw if they end a turn out of the light, ending the poisoned effect on a success.<br><br>You can command the creature to move up to 30 feet at the start of each of your turns. It has AC 14 and 100 hit points, and crumbles into nothingness if destroyed. If it suffers fire damage, it begins to critically overheat. At the end of your next turn if it is still alive, it explodes, and every creature within 90 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 12d6 fire damage, halved on a success. Damage taken this way can't be negated, and reduces your maximum hit points by twice the damage taken. The explosion area becomes permanently affected, causing creatures that end their turn inside to lose 1d6 maximum hit points.","empower":""}
