Its temperature drops to chilling levels, leaving only you and creatures you choose unaffected. All other creatures in the area that start their turn inside must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 cold damage and have their movement speed halved. A creature that succeeds on their saving throw takes half damage and does not lose movement speed. Objects in this area take 25 cold damage at the start of each of your turns.<br><br>Objects created by your Cold spells inside this area have resistance to all damage and absorb cold damage. If a Cold spell you cast creates an object, it refunds 1 AP and half of its MP cost.<br><br>If you cast this spell again, you can choose to either grow your current effect radius by 30 feet, or discard it completely and start again at a new location.","empower":"Radius increased to 90 feet. If cast again, you can grow it by 90 feet."}
