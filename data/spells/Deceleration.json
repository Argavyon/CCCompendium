Every creature within the sphere when it is cast and when they start their turn inside of the sphere must succeed on an Intuition saving throw. On a failure, they become affected by the deceleration as well.<br><br>Affected creatures have their movement speed halved, have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, lose 1 AP, and can only make one attack per turn no matter how many attacks they would normally be able to make.<br><br>A creature outside the sphere can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.","empower":""}
