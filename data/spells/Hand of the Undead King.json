{"name":"Hand of the Undead King","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":8,"tags":["Necromancy","Unholy","Cold"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"From out of the ground at a target point within range rises a large-sized rotted hand, a representation of the First Zombie. The air in a 10 foot radius around it becomes freezingly cold, and non-undead creatures that start their turn within this radius take 3d6 cold damage and have their movement speed halved until the end of their turn.<br><br>The hand uses your proficiency modifier and spellcasting stat to determine its attack bonus. You can spend AP to command the hand as follows: <br>>For 1 AP, you can have the hand move up to 30 feet and attempt to strike a creature, dealing 4d6 bludgeoning and 4d6 unholy damage on a hit. <br>>For 2 AP, you can have the hand attempt to grapple a creature. A grappled creature takes 3d6 cold and 3d6 unholy damage at the start of each of its turns, and you are healed for the unholy damage dealt to the creature in this way. The hand can only grapple one creature at a time, and can't target creatures more than one size category larger than it.<br>>For 3 AP, you can have the hand move up to 30 feet and slam down, sending deathly cold air through all non-undead creatures in a 15 foot radius around it. They must make a Constitution saving throw or take 6d6 cold damage and have their movement speed set to 5 feet until the end of their next turn. A successful saving throw deals half damage and only halves their movement speed.<br><br>Casting this spell again removes the first hand. The hand is bound to the ground.","empower":"Summon two hands. You command both hands at once with each action."}
