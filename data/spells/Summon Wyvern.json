The wyvern obeys your mental commands and takes its turn immediately, interrupting your turn. It then takes its turn after your turn.<br><br>If you do not have the Summoning tag, the duration is reduced to 1 minute.<br><br>If you do not have the Draconic tag, the wyvern rebels against your unworthy control. You can't dismiss the wyvern by ending the spell early. If you lose concentration on the spell, the wyvern breaks free completely. It becomes hostile to everyone and prioritizes killing you over anything else.","empower":""}
