The flower can be ground into a deadly powder that invites death into the target when consumed.<br><br>A creature that ingests the powder becomes afflicted. At the start of each of its turns, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have one hit die destroyed. If no hit dice are remaining, the creature's maximum and current hit points are halved, and the effect ends. A creature that makes two consecutive successes ends the effect early.","empower": "Affected creatures can't receive any healing.","author": "CrusaderDroid"}
