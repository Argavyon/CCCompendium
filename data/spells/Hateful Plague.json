While infected, a creature's maximum hit points is set to their current hit points, and all damage taken is dealt to both current and maximum hit points.<br><br>A creature can't drop below 1 hit point while infected. Taking damage that would cause them to drop below 1 hit point instead causes them to drop prone and writhe in agony for the duration.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, the plague increases its radius by 30 feet.","empower":""}
