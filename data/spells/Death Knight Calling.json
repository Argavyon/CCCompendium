{"name":"Death Knight Calling","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":9,"tags":["Necromancy","Unholy"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"Touch","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You touch the body of a dead creature and reach out to their spirit, asking them to serve you in exchange for power. If they accept, their body rises as a powerful death knight under your command.<br><br>A creature that rises as a death knight has the following effects: <br>>Their creature type becomes undead.<br>>Their hit dice are increased to equal yours if their total hit dice would be lower.<br>>Their Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are increased by 2. If they would still be lower than 2, they are set to 2.<br>>They are immune to being charmed or frightened, absorb unholy damage, and are vulnerable to radiant damage.<br><br>Death knights retain their consciousness and morality. They follow your commands and cannot take an action that would injure you without your approval. If given no commands, a death knight will act on its own as it did in life.<br><br>A death knight reduced to 0 hit points is not destroyed or knocked unconscious, but is instead bound and contained within a black crystal that appears either in your possession, or at their prior location if you are dead. The crystal has 100 hit points, but if you are still alive, it is indestructible. You can release a death knight within a crystal during a rest, returning them to unlife and fully healing them as if they had finished a rest. If a crystal is destroyed, the death knight within is permanently killed.<br><br>You cannot cast this spell on yourself under any circumstances.","empower":""}
