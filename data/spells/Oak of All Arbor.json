{"name":"Oak of All Arbor","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Conjuration","Plant","Concentration"],"cost":"3 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"8 hours","desc":"You summon a massive oak tree, covering a 30 foot radius cylinder 300 feet tall, centered on a point within range. All creatures within the area are forcibly displaced to the nearest empty space. Any object fully contained within the area is destroyed. If the tree cannot grow to its full size, it splinters and breaks spectacularly, and all creatures within a 90 foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 8d10 piercing damage, halved on a success.<br><br>The oak is laden with all manner of greenery, from flowers to fruit to vines to thorns. When you cast a Plant spell, you can cast it using any point on the oak to calculate range. You can have the oak concentrate on another Plant spell for you if you cast a spell in this manner. During your turn, you can adjust the oak's structure to allow for creatures to climb on it, or to prevent creatures from climbing on it.<br><br>The oak is indestructible, unless the spell ends, whereupon it withers and dies at the end of your next turn, fading away. Casting this spell again causes the first oak to wither and die.","empower":""}
