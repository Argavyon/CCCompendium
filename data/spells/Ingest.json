{"name":"Ingest","author":"Uri de Vries","tier":2,"tags":["Enchantment"],"cost":"1 AP","range":"5ft / touch","duration":"1 hour","desc":"You usher a word in a whisper, which may only be a noun or a name. As the whisper is told, the words manifest as an illusory leech that enters another creature's ear of your choice. While the leech is in place, you'll know every phrase in which the word is said or written, or heard or seen by the host, so long you're still on the same plane.<br><br>For as long the leech is in place, you may spend an additional 2 AP. If you do, you may have the leech try to delve into it's host's brain. It must make an intelligence saving throw. On a fail, you may either have the host spill all its knowledge about the chosen word, or forget everything they know about it, but not both. On a fail or success, the spell then ends.","empower":""}
