{"name":"Invoke War","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":4,"tags":["Evocation","Arcane","Physical","Concentration"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"60 feet","duration":"1 minute","desc":"You infuse the ambient magic with lethal intent, creating an ethereal semi-sentient being of war. It has 3 AP, which replenishes at the end of each of your turns, and marks out a 60 foot radius around it. Every time a creature in the area is attacked or targeted by a damaging spell, the being of war spends 1 AP as a response to launch its own attack on the same creature, using your spellcasting stat and proficiency modifier to determine its attack roll. If multiple creatures are targeted, it picks the creature with the highest amount of hit points, randomly choosing a target on ties. On a hit, it inflicts 4d6 arcane damage if the trigger was a spell, and 2d6 piercing damage if the trigger was a weapon attack.<br><br>If you lose your concentration on the spell, the being of war does not disappear, but becomes berserk. Every time it would attack, it additionally targets you if you are still in range.","empower":""}
