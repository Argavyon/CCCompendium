While this spell is active, you cannot take any action except making attacks or devoting AP towards this spell, however you also permanently benefit from the effects of the disengage and dodge actions.<br><br>For each AP to devote to this spell, 2 glimmering flower petals appear and swirl around you, joining you in the dance. You may have a maximum of 6 petals around you at once. When this spell ends, any remaining petals linger until the end of your next turn.<br><br>Whenever you attack one or more creatures within 60 feet of you while this spell is active, 1 petal is consumed as it flies out at your targets. The targets must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.","empower":"Immediately create 3 petals when you cast this spell.<br>When cast at a higher tier, the range of this spell doubles for every tier above 4."}
