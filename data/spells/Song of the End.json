If you spend at least 1 AP during your turn towards casting this spell, you gain temporary hit points equal to five times your spellcasting stat per AP spent.<br><br>While casting, all creatures within range immediately know you are casting a powerful spell. Most sentient creatures with means will attempt to target you to force you to stop. Creatures with fewer hit dice than your level must instead make an Intuition saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute and take any measures required to leave the area of effect.<br><br>When completed, a devastating wave of force rushes from you and blasts the area of the spell. Creatures within range take 8d10+20 arcane damage, and must make an Intuition saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage, halved on a success. Terrain in the area is utterly destroyed, leaving a hollowed out hole. Objects that fit completely within the area are destroyed.<br><br>A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is disintegrated.","empower":"A number of creatures equal to your spellcasting stat within range are unaffected by this spell."}
