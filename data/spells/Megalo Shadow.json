{"name":"Megalo Shadow","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":7,"tags":["Illusion","Beast","Shadow","Water","Concentration"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Self (90 foot radius)","duration":"1 minute","desc":"The ground ripples as a massive illusory shark made of shadows bursts from the ground, swimming as if the land is an ocean.<br><br>At the start of each of your turns, the shark immediately rushes towards the creature with the fewest hit dice that is still hostile. That creature must make an Intuition saving throw or roll three of its remaining hit dice and take psychic damage equal to the number rolled. Damage dealt this way is deducted from maximum hit points, and the hit dice are destroyed. A creature without hit dice remaining instead loses half of its current hit points and is frightened for the duration, and the shark will not attack that creature again.<br><br>If you frighten a creature during your turn, the shark immediately attacks that creature.<br><br>The spell ends early if you leave the area.","empower":""}
