{"name":"Serpent Lock","author":"CrusaderDroid","tier":3,"tags":["Conjuration","Poison","Silent"],"cost":"2 AP","range":"Sight","duration":"1 hour","desc":"You loose a transparent snake-like construct of poison magic that targets one creature you can see. Now and at the start of each of your turns, it moves 30 feet towards the target. Upon reaching the target, it \"bites\", subsuming itself into the target. It must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is paralyzed for the duration. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On the first time it succeeds, it is no longer paralyzed but has its movement set to 0. On the second success, its movement is halved. On the third success, the spell ends. The creature is unaware it has been affected by a spell in this manner, perceiving it as a strange failure of their body.<br><br>A creature that succeeds on the initial saving throw has their movement speed reduced by half for the duration and is aware they have been affected. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat the saving throw with advantage to end the effect on a success.<br><br>The spell camouflages itself to avoid detection. It takes the closest possible path to reach its target, climbing around obstacles and squeezing through any opening larger than one inch. If it ends its movement in an empty space, a creature can identify it with a DC 20 Intuition saving throw. If the target is aware of the spell, it automatically succeeds on its first saving throw against the spell.","empower":"After the creature recovers from being paralyzed, it is also poisoned until the spell ends. The spell moves 45 feet per turn instead."}
