It takes its turn after yours and obeys your mental commands, but cannot act on its own.<br><br>The oozemass has AC 0, 800 hit points, absorbs acid, and is vulnerable to all other forms of damage. On its turn, it is only able to move 15 feet. Any terrain it passes through becomes difficult terrain sizzling with acid that deals 1d6 acid damage to any creature for every 5 feet moved within it. If the oozemass moves through a creature's space, it is engulfed. At the start of each engulfed creature's turn, it takes 6d6 acid damage, and the oozemass heals a number of hit points equal to half the damage done. An engulfed creature can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw for 2 AP during their turn to escape to an empty adjacent space on a success.<br><br>The oozemass disappears when the spell ends, releasing all engulfed creatures.","empower":"The oozemass immediately moves 15 feet upon being summoned."}
