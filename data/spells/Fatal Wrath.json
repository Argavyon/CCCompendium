They must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 8d6 damage, split evenly between arcane and unholy damage. A successful saving throw deals half damage.<br><br>If a reanimated creature is targeted, or if the target creature is reduced to 0 hit points, an additional bolt springs from them at any other creature within range you choose. You can target a previously targeted creature with these additional bolts. A creature that fails a saving throw against this spell fails all successive saving throws against this spell. These bolts cannot trigger additional bolts.","empower":"Fires two more bolts."}
